don &apos;t start .
but .
sing@@ ing .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
sounds good ?
a lot .
i can help .
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re going to lose them .
oh my god !
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
home ?
we pick it off .
we love entertain@@ ment .
oh my god .

.
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
in@@ efficient .
wonderful , it &apos;s it ?
efficient .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
what a fish .
sustainable .
that &apos;s me .
exciting .
very different term .
they &apos;re all important .
essential .
so they meet al .
and she did .
thank you very much .
this was the result .
just do your job .
good work ! yeah !
yeah , good day .
similar principles .
that &apos;s our present .
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
the whole environmental discussion .
what do you say ?
we can do that .
i &apos;m all interested in this .
len@@ to , slowly , slow .
yeah , good day .
that &apos;s already on .
this is the system .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta
they did ?
farm is incredible .
can i be honest ?
fascinating .
that &apos;s great important .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar ?
what was the result ?
but what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so the one .
very good .
a few more .
it door .
why not live longer ?
it has sensor@@ s .
here &apos;s the video .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
i was ama@@ zed .
ban is blan@@ k .
but what ?
what happened here ?
centers built .
i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s important .
guess .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , very good .
what happened here ?
these people make money .
these days are over .
can we change ?
this is the last one .
flying c@@ at
yeah , that goes .
what today ?
we can do it differently .
and that has to go back .
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
let &apos;s call him don .
and i was an artist .
that &apos;s a wish .
b@@ g : thank you .
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because do you know what ?
how do we know ?
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
you can go into it .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
how interested .
so how does this work ?
they use hands .
this interesting .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
what do these people need ?
somehow doesn &apos;t work .
so let &apos;s see .
they &apos;re dra@@ g@@ ging . &quot;
so they &apos;re going to do that .
players don &apos;t sit around .
i was fac@@ ed with him .
okay . thank you very much .
here &apos;s an example .
so she was back .
and i continu@@ ed to work .
this happens to us today .
what do you want to do ?
i want to tell you .
oh . there &apos;s a moment .
why does this happen ?
thank you .
we need .
there are two op@@ tions .
i go in here .
or bom@@ bs .
but i continu@@ ed to work .
not tox@@ .
you see it immediately .
they even hurt .
why should we do that ?
thank you for listening .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
wonder .
i swe@@ ar it .
great .
i represent children .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but wrong things .
it &apos;s against justice .
there &apos;s no food .
challenge .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
maybe 10 times .
be a ment@@ or .
thank you very much .
so here you see it .
but it gets even worse .
j@@ k both .
imagine the camera .
yeah . all right .
i created one .
first of all , limited .
after just one journey there .
my gut feeling again .
what creates illusion ?
and so it was .
very expensive real e@@ state .
and i always had .
does anybody see something particular ?
give pe@@ e a chance .
but not protection .
lu@@ ck@@ ily is &apos;t , right ?
in china , it was different .
you place compar@@ ons .
i mean the sou@@ l .
what all need to be done ?
really cool . &quot;
and that &apos;s amazing .
and why ?
i agree with you .
yeah , here it is .
he had experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
i think not .
some of them have come and went .
o@@ oh , thank you .
will i like the color ?
good after@@ noon , everybody together .
this is where you see the city .
he liked enjo@@ like it .
she did that secre@@ tly .
and it got better .
it &apos;s an almost iden@@ tical structure .
is that also your opini@@ on ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is am@@ it .
just on . a lot of fun .
answer is no .
okay , more .
let me wra@@ p up .
there were re@@ mix .
and then international .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h .
he &apos;s my grand@@ father grand@@ father .
is it even photograph@@ y ?
here &apos;s another example .
but there &apos;s something else .
saw these guys ?
it has billions .
i &apos;ll never forget .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
we lost .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not .
it would be in@@ toler@@ able .
crisis . death . disaster .
and a lot of people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened .
he always showed here .
still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are online crimin@@ als .
priv@@ acy must given .
now , what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
don &apos;t be dis@@ coura@@ un@@ med .
... inv@@ ent his own story .
how do we humans actually work ?
they had mass media .
but where are we useful ?
interpre@@ ting work .
that &apos;s ahead .
let &apos;s call it don .
but what does your fish eat ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
first of all , we have the population .
who &apos;s going to make sure it ?
so what do you think what happened now ?
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
the game is from 2007 .
i want to ask you a little bit .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
who are these rela@@ tives ?
so what happened ?
i had a good life .
the water coming .
this is the short .
i grew up in india .
is it about the light ?
they look like this .
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
the only country in the world .
i think this fascinating .
i think this fascinating .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , he didn &apos;t die .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
why not think about it ?
you see that down there .
you have to understand that .
that &apos;s what most of you know here .
we need to spread news .
you don &apos;t you want to do that ?
sounds crazy , right ?
is it going to have my size ?
his name is temp@@ t .
what am i ?
that &apos;s something of it .
but what do we do ?
and this op@@ ens up a map .
we &apos;re bu@@ pus@@ hing all the other .
it would be knowing .
we love creativity .
he went up and down .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
they had books .
so what do we need to do ?
creativity comes from conflict .
or maybe it be possible ?
he &apos;s the guy left .
you can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
we &apos;re too many .
we were 20 people .
it sounds evil .
maybe that &apos;s reality .
so let &apos;ll finish .
this is what the graph looked like .
what else can we do ?
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
remote technology .
they called me .
but i felt bad .
they really loved it .
what &apos;s the sou@@ l ?
i can argue .
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
orange .
what actually happened ?
and then they them up .
so the way it works .
but the key thing is ...
that is the exciting .
what about fit@@ ness ?
these changes are coming .
one place is south korea .
and that &apos;s nothing .
i don &apos;t have to worry about !
and the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
they could have done it better .
like , you know .
what is this one thing ?
this is what happened around christ@@ mas .
this is why ha@@ cking now ?
so it &apos;s circle .
does that make you curious ?
because you can train that .
and how did that feel ?
my wife told me .
this is a natural thing .
again , you have it again .
thank you for your attention .
i just loved two of them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i wanted to support them .
they want to feed the world ?
who &apos;s most successful ?
the same thing , only bigger .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and finally , epi@@ c importance .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
well , i was the next one .
first exten@@ sion , second .
they saw the big impact .
and then everybody went down .
i was stru@@ ed by a@@ we .
this was the beginning of the journey .
but very sad .
and very well .
this is very ris@@ ky .
tell me about this world .
and it took 18 months .
i see this sign .
this picture is from this place .
think about your own decisions .
okay , there few .
her mother pulled her alone .
these two people .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
sometimes i push too much .
and is cru@@ x .
and the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
so let me remember .
is that reas@@ on@@ able ?
that &apos;s god , do you know ?
this is a game outside .
for example , this perception in context .
anyone know what that is ?
our anima@@ tion should still work .
it was just &apos;t invented yet .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
they always say , why ?
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
so they saw something ma@@ gical .
it was a huge success .
so that &apos;s the good news .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
so , we can do that too .
how many people would choose creativity ?
is this just education ?
now , how could this happen ?
play is not sil@@ ly .
the data was &apos;t available before .
you can have this cloud .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the power plant can explo@@ de .
i not say that .
they come from artists .
and again , he showed him ja@@ four .
it &apos;s all important op@@ tions . &quot;
well , then we &apos;re going to go .
what happened that day ?
the story is not over yet .
no had never been a way .
sometimes perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
but not that fast .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
i was really sad .
it &apos;s not citizens .
and good news .
talk about water wars .
and there are hundreds of them .
i learned everything .
she was back .
it shares her experiences with others .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
he actually colle@@ cted fish .
it was my first .
people were still happy .
let them be bal@@ i . &quot;
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we do everything .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
right now that &apos;s waste .
an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
he doesn &apos;t have that sou@@ l .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation .
and of course , incredibly talks .
doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
i almost never che@@ ok with it .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
what should our te@@ stim@@ ony look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
don &apos;t take anything as gran@@ ted .
and he actually says that way .
so paul is a terror@@ ist ist .
nobody ever said this before .
the data does this all the time .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
they &apos;re creating an epi@@ c story .
which one would you like the most ?
and this was 19 years ago .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
the morning , before the game .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
the whole building was made of water .
you can play with different ways .
and then something weird happened .
what other br@@ ands are like this ?
so this is one of the images .
basically , they do the same thing .
and then we did .
we went an area .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
today it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
i talk a lot about these questions .
that was gran@@ dio@@ .
the white lines are for the population .
but you know what ?
i started feeling better .
but there are two problems .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
so the question : how ?
and we &apos;re too many .
every waste is nutri@@ ent .
and we &apos;re very happy .
and you have a problem .
there are four and a half thousand people there .
it &apos;s just not technologi@@ cal .
he showed the al@@ ga@@ e .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
what kind of lessons have we learned ?
it has the biggest impact .
below that , other things shouldn not suff@@ er .
and then realize it .
because anybody here ?
they become free computers .
this is about five meters long .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
we all love baseball , right ?
and she beat a 25@@ 7 .
my second mistake was worse .
one , we started one alive .
okay , that &apos;s really coura@@ ge .
then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and the shape is playing a role .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
further than that , we don &apos;t go .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
slowly , but certainly , it changed .
it gets more and more .
because i can argue everything .
this is all the meta@@ data .
we use the sun &apos;s energy .
i &apos;ll give you something .
and it starts with a doctor .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
asked the nur@@ se tly .
today , everything &apos;s easy to have .
creativity somehow had to get out .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
next , nuclear energy .
i really wanted normal then .
i got a sc@@ ared of technology .
so i went to the court .
we can &apos;t just do that .
as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
i &apos;m going to show that to you .
that sounds fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
that &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
well , my brand ?
let &apos;s quie@@ tly that .
this is completely in@@ vi@@ al .
zer@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ le@@ mis@@ sions , yeah ?
but we need that all .
but effective , right ?
the reasons to write it .
now i tried something exciting .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
what is a story ?
i remember my first fire .
who you are .
what else ris@@ ky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
her family gather@@ .
and his answer was yes .
you can &apos;t do anything like that out of nothing .
do you want je@@ ans ?
the truth is more like this .
and but that &apos;s at the very beginning .
anyway , not to navi@@ gate .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
we say sustain@@ ability in germany .
how and what did he feel ?
because for me , it means memory .
this is like learning .
have you ever been ti@@ vy before ?
i &apos;m going to sho@@ ot something through my head .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
and then we said , okay .
so i just started playing .
it really changed the dynamic .
so , look at what happens .
so the cor@@ relation is small .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
the game starts -- sil@@ .
and this video is in real time .
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this &apos;s a child game , right ?
that didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
i went to ja@@ il -- hard .
i like things different .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
all adults were aware of the risks .
it spre@@ ads rapi@@ dly .
it can know where we are .
why did i go to medicine ?
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
and there are several reasons .
we started 15 years ago .
sun@@ light and co2 are a techni@@ que .
i think it &apos;s happy .
this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
in the book and the picture .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
we can gain our nutri@@ ents .
that &apos;s the minim@@ um .
you can show , i was there .
if you come to that , right ?
that must be the age .
and yet , it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
so the first step to an interpretation .
you know what nei@@ vy is ?
so it &apos;s right right in the middle .
how far do you get ?
music is medicine . music .
in as@@ sum@@ mption of maybe two percent .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the chan@@ n@@ els .
i stop , thank you very much .
i could draw . i could paint .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
anyway , we need a solution .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that can make a big difference .
it has nothing to do with science .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
five million people use it every month .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
these will be in@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
and you know what i learned ?
it turns out really hard .
do we really want to go this way ?
you can do this all the time .
but the truth is far away .
he can only use his eyes .
i really like beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
you see something fun .
it seemed it was quite popular .
this is an object image .
so we measu@@ red his movement .
now that &apos;s not right .
something went inside me .
oh , my time is over ?
they didn &apos;t give up the government up .
and these are neu@@ ral structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
but maybe this is not the case .
because we live on a water planet .
baseball is great statistics .
i &apos;m not going to take the same course .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
they had been gene@@ tically placed .
priv@@ acy is not debate .
le@@ go made it possible .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
a has these benefits and risks .
these ri@@ vers take rapi@@ dly .
this is about memory bas@@ ds .
this is where makes the sun up .
was a pretty fortun@@ y project .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
and what does that mean for designers ?
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
he was over 50 .
and this sounds very different before .
no , no , not .
i fell from this fish .
are you going to do that for the kids ? &quot;
one billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
now i see gre@@ g le@@ mond .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
architec@@ ts and engineers , lu@@ ck@@ ily .
i push my sle@@ ve back .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
no , i don &apos;t mean it really seriously .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so this crazy story could be true .
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
we won some pri@@ ces .
and i had to go away out of the city .
okay , you really want to know that ?
that was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
you want to ori@@ ent in the museum ?
but then they really want to go deep .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
here &apos;s her brand gang .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
we need to increase complexity .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
her father died soon after birth .
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been too simple .
who would ever wish one ?
but it requires a lot of planning .
and every morning i jum@@ ped on it .
we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
how do i re@@ move it away ? &quot;
now we do air@@ planes .
i learned this from my grandmother .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i started with my usual talk .
it &apos;s about transforma@@ tive standards ments .
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
the st@@ cks are color co@@ ded .
longer than these other two networks .
and often in the third , you for@@ gotten again .
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
in way we think about the north north .
we can rein@@ vent it .
i started an institute .
that &apos;s how natural things are done .
he &apos;s auto@@ matically running for the right thought .
they &apos;re called today project project car@@ am@@ ers .
it &apos;s bus@@ y with in@@ sur@@ ten@@ ce .
simple , that &apos;s how it will come .
today 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
and that got me so through .
this is ide@@ ology , not science .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
i call this the bright tiger .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
we need to think what br@@ ands .
the film hasn &apos;t yet deli@@ vered yet .
they even bring in fund@@ ing .
here is o@@ live oil going .
who do you want to in@@ form ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who could have looked looked all this ?
i talked a lot about magic .
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
my brother star@@ ed at me .
this is what to be trans@@ mit@@ ted publi@@ c@@ ly .
we &apos;ve already running a lot of process .
we don &apos;t really really know a lot about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think there are possibilities .
in fact , we re@@ defined poverty .
risk is not a simple game .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
b@@ j@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud .
and everybody in this room has to in .
the result was cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
we &apos;ve achie@@ ved a kind of equ@@ equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
they gave their blood levels .
the living gave birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes something .
the people about the ur@@ ine .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
there are also record .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
in what words , would you describe ban ban ?
they add very well .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the other one had strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
and nobody seems to rain about that .
all these generations need few milli@@ seconds .
i tried to understand them .
for energy , i noticed here .
and here you feel it .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
the students are being divi@@ divi@@ ded gra@@ notes .
say what you feel .
they went through each other .
here the building works .
the question is , what ?
he &apos;s interested in making .
that &apos;s where he sig@@ ned up .
here &apos;s this little mechan@@ ism .
let &apos;s make a little inter@@ balance .
completely tar@@ ge@@ ted on a particular goal .
he died broken by history .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply deeply .
you lose rare and rare animals .
we built unique elements here .
that basically sounds unusual .
the by@@ product is clean water .
so there are two cy@@ cles .
most of all , if he had already died .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
they &apos;ve literally la@@ id the le@@ ver around .
it &apos;s been gone consi@@ const@@ ant so far .
so this is a hard shot .
they have . they always have .
what do you think happens next ?
jo@@ oles@@ ds are just bel@@ ong to our lives .
it cost cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
let &apos;s start with reali@@ ving .
it turns off the eng@@ ors off .
so , not so optimi@@ stic .
you brought your pictures along , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
poli@@ , everybody appl@@ au@@ ed .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
he with@@ moved back to the sil@@ ence .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked late to night .
so scot@@ t gets this fru@@ stration .
lead some mu@@ tations .
they kept us from being inspired to be inspired .
i represent death cells .
i wrote these crazy things .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
we go through initi@@ ation ritu@@ als .
they &apos;re the home countries of somebody .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
these are all questions .
it &apos;s about a re@@ co@@ very of america .
we have to get far , fast .
and that &apos;s what they do .
so modern modern computer society .
you &apos;re going to see from the back to the front .
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , right .
it &apos;s also such a paradig@@ m shift .
and the curi@@ osity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
this is just a little less destruction .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
we can support them to be good .
we can support them to be good .
but with the right design , please you go .
the mechan@@ ism is from lying .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
we also got very cise data .
this will happen next apri@@ l .
he sha@@ ke his head , no .
it was really profound .
we &apos;re talking about t@@ ally about it .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read the post to you .
sexual re@@ production comes into the picture .
the main man win@@ me to me .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and women succe@@ ed success@@ ed .
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
the roof was also covered water .
this is a painting of a circle .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
no , what i thought .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
we &apos;re talking about b@@ old , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel came .
even cat@@ s look at this video .
i never met him personally .
i thought everybody could do that .
it might take to be invited .
something very strange is happening here .
you should also wish which .
what will these three billion people bring ?
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
and that was what felt .
but i kept asking these questions .
this is the system we live in .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
she wasn &apos;t dro@@ w@@ k yet .
but today we &apos;re beyond beyond .
they ta@@ p their internet connection .
15@@ 6 nations are sending our tv chan@@ nel .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
no , no , far missing .
maybe maybe take a look at it too .
in fact , to say , what is information ?
i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
what takes fif@@ ty milli@@ seconds ?
what &apos;s just been shown .
this is such a contra@@ cted part .
you put box a box .
the che@@ f had coo@@ ked him .
i &apos;m an rela@@ t . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; &quot; he said .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
mor@@ e@@ over , these sources are under@@ lying inter@@ rup@@ tions .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks .
there &apos;s never been a time like this before .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve disappe@@ ared .
does anybody know at all know what that is ?
not even the truth will free it .
we have mas@@ ers in this country .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
and why ? gene@@ tically changed food .
it also plays a role .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure
and there are staf@@ f in a of staf@@ f .
so the first exciting pri@@ mate .
we can pay ourselves ourselves .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people later .
now of these kinds of species don &apos;t exist with us .
let me tell you a little bit .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump . &quot;
so that &apos;s why this project .
and that was the out@@ break of .
temp@@ t is completely paraly@@ zed today .
make it possible -- you all here .
tell me a little bit about this part .
they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct of the story .
and i want to read you that .
somebody made an ol@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
the sh@@ ore is from a different place .
this is a mo@@ dest little little ap@@ p .
boston has not just a call center .
so there creates a feedback connection .
it can know how we keep it .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
&quot; a p@@ ale p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
maybe i did good reason .
exc@@ extin@@ ct , they measu@@ red five centi@@ meters .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
so li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its is open source .
now this level of intuition is going to very important .
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al flow of water .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
he has to process that as a present .
i &apos;m trying to try this through an example .
his personal impres@@ sions of se@@ ero@@ chs .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
and then he can just walk away .
because now you can now apply a tri@@ sentence .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
bad ? i was conf@@ used .
and then , what do you do with the waste ?
there &apos;s some that has to come together .
they lead the process , they understand it .
the guy in the middle not so much .
we don &apos;t want companies to common .
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
what does this look like ? pretty good .
we get an absolutely flat line .
dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
but it &apos;s not just words .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
you can see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
the whole film &apos;s goal is transpar@@ ency .
eat a bow@@ ell of cool whi@@ p .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artist directly .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
now who &apos;s ready for this journey ?
here &apos;s two different je@@ wel@@ ry plants .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
my cou@@ s@@ ins were walking around everywhere .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
peace , sh@@ ame and without support .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it was a grou@@ per .
a language is expression of human mind .
now let &apos;s get something else out .
yeah . it does nothing but discover .
but i &apos;m going to get to talk again in a moment .
the environment , make less waste .
it should con@@ tain the two elements .
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
well , then i &apos;m going to show it to you .
he had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
thank you . i have a question for you .
but the game is a for@@ mal trans@@ duc@@ er .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y ended up won .
this is ro@@ ber@@ to dance .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important about the context .
ordinary people are not available available . &quot;
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
the next step now within these communities .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get ti@@ red like all of us .
sleep de@@ pri@@ sleep is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
but western governments also help themselves .
this is my super@@ market . big .
in other areas -- the world of communic@@ ations .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
this is one , part of her .
and e@@ col@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
it really sol@@ ves the fuel problem .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
two minutes later , three things happened simul@@ tane@@ ously .
this is just the labor , by the way .
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural videos .
the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
and so on , now you see it .
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
so basically , a trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
so what can we close from all of this ?
isn &apos;t that half a half or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that number up .
what action do i appe@@ al for ?
you can predict that . why does this happen ?
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
this country is different 40 years ago .
so this has been a problem for super@@ computers .
there are many great books about this .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can quant@@ ture .
the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f did all the str@@ ands .
in two hours , she buil@@ ds everywhere .
now the instru@@ ments have moved ed .
or take a li@@ p pen .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum .
i want to explain that a little bit a little bit .
three sentence , you still know from school .
in this three , three sent@@ ences happen .
in fact , bear didn &apos;t want to make a vi@@ ral video .
they make us standing there .
the water quanti@@ unts have exp@@ and@@ ed .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
imagine efficient .
so , help me a little bit .
do you remember the wind again ?
and then it usually looks like this .
it kind of wired us .
if you burn coal : no .
mon@@ day : color is something powerful .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
we asked around , and nobody knew .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
rein@@ ding america . find out more .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and you can continue the list end@@ less@@ ly .
so what are arch@@ a@@ mic models ?
so it &apos;s more like the nor@@ m about that .
everybody &apos;s already aten ca@@ ke .
and there &apos;s a central point .
no , we realize what &apos;s inside .
now can you play them in blue ?
say , there &apos;s no predi@@ ction .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
so , that really ble@@ w me mind .
burn natural gas , no .
you know science is not a company .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
people suff@@ ered . people f@@ ought .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
maybe we can see of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence as a change .
raise your hands . let me see .
imagine that for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
second hal@@ f ##AT##-##AT## @@ time . end of the normal game time .
that means something built in the city .
imagine an airplane full of smo@@ ke .
you just have to spread as far as possible .
you go around and am@@ use .
you can very easily zo@@ om in .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
we now think about energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
i call it the coming billion .
it &apos;s a game called dit .
let me show you how they work .
you just listen and start talking .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
third , es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
your problem is they have too little .
they laugh@@ ed more than you do here .
the new chromo@@ some went to the cell .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
if not , somebody else squ@@ ks today .
and that &apos;s great because we need .
now i &apos;m going to add a b@@ ass .
now if you think about a little further .
and the two lat@@ ter are also here here today .
now you see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
this is called the o@@ si@@ model .
sha@@ ke the environment , &apos;t use less energy .
because that &apos;s evidence , right ?
you can go into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
we talk about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning in information . &quot;
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
and there &apos;s the stor@@ age problem .
my parents are 80 on the he@@ els .
we forced them . pu@@ ff .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we re@@ je@@ ct gene@@ tically changed food .
what ? that really fre@@ me out .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to re@@ store health after a disease .
it &apos;s not just just a crazy idea .
they &apos;re in the back of the back of our body .
th@@ ur@@ day : confidence is the key .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but the reality is always un@@ predic@@ table .
it was something we knew to do .
you should tell me something about my brand .
you come in in two ways -- very simple .
it cap@@ tures a thousand square kilometers .
third technology : categ@@ ory .
my fourth technology : assu@@ mption for complexity .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
but so many got help over the years .
life had not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and let me show you a simple example .
i work in the solar technology industry .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
i said , &quot; ok , om@@ a . &quot;
well , i walked into the court room .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
i remember like it was been yesterday .
the three words were : remember ?
we still think they &apos;re original .
i thought i could integra@@ te .
so that &apos;s what the super@@ market is like .
here &apos;s some on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
now , this carto@@ on makes some stat@@ ements .
seriously -- the mis@@ line !
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
and if not , still dance your dance .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked with red .
anyway , they do that in it .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
this is bal@@ an@@ ced in china in a second .
it &apos;s all in there is useful .
all of them is com@@ com@@ pos@@ ble of it .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go on slide slide .
our goal was to say , okay .
and in time , you can re@@ act others again .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
but i didn &apos;t get rid of that .
this has to go down to zero .
the internet and the services is a mira@@ cle .
we need to use for more research money .
you &apos;re hop@@ ing that we don &apos;t need that .
my grand@@ parents push that number to 70 .
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve rid of which didn &apos;t work .
sh@@ ame . sh@@ ame .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
let me show you from the ne@@ ar@@ by .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
what we want is create the future .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
so go ; save the shoes .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality happens in many different forms .
so that made sense fit sed .
so again , that fit really well .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and this is a million company .
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intui@@ tive .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
mot@@ ines , ge@@ ves -- four possibilities .
nobody has to give green light to your ideas .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is it about the details or the colors ?
and then it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the different images .
and here , every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
scot@@ t talked from human to human .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and yet , we seem to be quite satis@@ fied with it .
we create new ten@@ sions and conflict .
then he wh@@ is@@ ed my ear .
what would you tell somebody who belie@@ ves that ?
and there &apos;s a very good reason .
and this is very important in medical research .
there can be a sequence of changes .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
so you can &apos;t put them wrong around .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
at first , we &apos;ve just sig@@ ned sig@@ it .
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
and they had to re@@ away what we did .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it .
that ec@@ ology is a global global .
that &apos;s where every foot@@ print is advan@@ ta@@ ged .
pic@@ as@@ so says , wait wait .
nobody &apos;s done this one in the world like way .
then smar@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ grid off@@ ers .
what &apos;s food production ? &quot;
every morning they fly 2@@ 40 kilometers to farm .
and every night , they fly 2@@ 40 kilometers back .
so i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government . &quot;
i was totally excited ll@@ ed , you know .
they live with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
this &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
let &apos;s pre@@ tend if we had a machine here .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
there &apos;s somebody in the back who had no childhood .
i would usually take the need@@ le out .
thank you very much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
it was almost beyond imagination .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
ladies and gentle@@ men , your rela@@ tives .
so two cou@@ irs , each one has a baby .
so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ simpli@@ ing idea .
so i think we need to be leaders .
on the left , you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer will be ?
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
these things have a more positive effect .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
i mean , no one has ever seen a partic@@ le .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true .
it has a butt@@ on on / out .
next week , this comes to the market .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and try the whole thing again with another generation .
story@@ telling takes more and more senses .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
and we kept increase our expec@@ tations .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and i went back to work .
the question is why people accept that .
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and security .
we &apos;ve always always tried to ask important questions .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , right ?
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . stopped .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
what happened that we could do that .
and they &apos;re not just just going to die of mas@@ ks .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it was summer and i had shor@@ ts .
and of course , then it made a click .
i want to show you something here first .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- their fing@@ ers go along .
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i never want to move anything in life .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
it &apos;s &apos;t come out in other countries .
but the best part is still -- in a second .
now i &apos;ll show you my favorite function .
there had to be another piece of puzz@@ le .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is vote .
when i was 16 , i started illu@@ str@@ ating books .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
and i have to say , there gave me power .
notice two things to this cur@@ ve .
do you know what to call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
i asked them , and i went to the treatment .
it suppor@@ ts when others talk about their mistakes .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and it &apos;s all of pac@@ ka@@ aging or content .
so don &apos;t save , den@@ it , avoid .
so every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
so smar@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ grid , a giant top@@ ic everywhere .
let , instead , look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
the last three three of the five i &apos;ve sum@@ bled up .
that &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
it was in it@@ al@@ y four a half years ago .
and we need to improve a lot about this device .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
in fact , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
so the theme of the day : saving saving .
and keep a reali@@ stic level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
there are some interesting develop@@ ments .
we want to do something about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer that at nine .
it was going to roll on them across the country .
i &apos;m really sorry . does this make you crazy ?
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation .
all who were like this started divi@@ ding up .
he came to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
and i &apos;m going to wra@@ p that quickly for you .
technical cy@@ cles are the same .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want that .
it was a lot on , and i was a hur@@ ry .
we have no identity , we inv@@ ent it .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to humans .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society through the language .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable development pattern .
you saw it in the news .
and in that head , memory memory .
we understood weather weather global .
and what &apos;s actually there ?
in the countries where people are coming to money .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things at all .
they &apos;ve in@@ ver@@ ted the flow of the water .
and this is what i found incredibly exciting .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
what would it like to live longer in good health ?
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you here .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
store that off , ele@@ te the rest .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all the time .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
there are these di@@ a@@ pers are lying around , almost all .
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
so this was a very strange experience .
did you take all your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ i mel@@ ons .
as i said , am@@ anda is our gs .
both &apos;re vi@@ able , both light .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand ger@@ ry ?
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands have done .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
no apple ever looked like this .
i wasn not familiar with the lab@@ el .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
writing down dna was an interesting step .
the sil@@ ence is ear num@@ bing .
we want to lower the number of pris@@ on@@ ers .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
and give to my top doctor .
one of them , i thought he had kid@@ ney st@@ ones .
the corpo@@ rate head@@ quar@@ ters is right here .
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial .
in fact , coal is not dir@@ ty .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
yeah , so what &apos;s bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
that means we need to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and we see that it works .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
not all is supposed to be , of course , com@@ post@@ able .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you can still with them either .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
fl@@ amin@@ gos eat sh@@ ri@@ mp .
i think the curi@@ osity is first .
that u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
now they understood the advantage of prototyp@@ ing .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
there seems to be dis@@ agre@@ ement .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
i want to do it by i don &apos;t die . &quot;
and that &apos;s not just true in terms of gender .
but how do you do that in practice ?
here &apos;s the results we just got .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
this is something like our fight scre@@ am .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
do you know how many people are looking at these ted@@ talks ?
and the answer will be likely will be no .
they absolutely didn &apos;t want anything to do with the project .
we found that it moves really strange .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so i think the principles are very simple .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
good night , swe@@ et mar@@ yl@@ ac@@ rat . &quot;
so each dro@@ p@@ let was a little bit different .
say , &quot; please repe@@ this process . &quot;
and i becomes a character in the book .
i remember it was yesterday .
we have access to exponenti@@ al technology tools .
so all of this sum@@ mary , mistakes are inevi@@ inevi@@ table .
so you don &apos;t lose any frequ@@ coming animals .
they get rare because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but leaving is not always a bad thing .
this is images over a th@@ fes@@ pan of six seconds .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
if your job is dance , dance .
and they also feel your mov@@ ements and tenden@@ cy .
now he &apos;s pul@@ ling a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
i can do the sequence as it runs down .
or they didn &apos;t have any a phot@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
the whole is a game , i have to say that .
it &apos;s , in a sense , an behavior act po@@ op print .
and in my you@@ th , i said , expec@@ tation .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
about interpretation is har@@ ely spo@@ ken in the beginn@@ er class .
a phr@@ ase with its own breath .
why do i have to afford a little car like this ?
he just dec@@ ei@@ s them and not himself .
because we can &apos;t live without that lies .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
na@@ than@@ iel , music means mental health .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
these stupid films don &apos;t make us money .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on the top .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
probably many of you in this room know this trick .
... that there &apos;s a role the do@@ ses as well .
and you ask , what &apos;s going to happen to these moments ?
it &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
you see , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
i learned that everything &apos;s different in a moment .
and this is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net .
i want to tell you how we found that .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
what &apos;s the next you want to talk about .
or are you more like down@@ down at@@ tri@@ te ?
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
and finally , wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
and that was an experience in hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
in 2010 , it had been 23 million times .
and all of this leads us to the one big question .
i made the decision to move to the u.@@ s .
and that worked . appl@@ ause scot@@ t .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
and we use this word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
she had the last word in every family argument .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affec@@ ts the out@@ come .
all right , really good , maybe a all@@ -@@ star .
i was a incredibly obs@@ essi@@ ve student .
and that wasn &apos;t a hard to diagno@@ sis .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
and we can navi@@ gate this very simple way .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually doing this now ?
they virtu@@ alize reality , and they &apos;s all without computers .
from a@@ vi@@ an age to the machine age .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
so my two passi@@ ons went up .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
there &apos;s a connection , a mu@@ tual respect .
i thought let &apos;d bring the pollen ker in the same .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right to ?
but one of them is much worse than the other .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.@@ 5 billion billion in total .
8@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
but are we going to do the best out of our play drive ?
we see the same thing in the dis@@ ab@@ led rights movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance and it &apos;s just nat@@ ance .
and there was a lot of crazy things going on .
em@@ c : &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
here we were , and this is the painting .
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
we have all the navi@@ gation systems in our cars .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
this is the call center for service and information .
now we do this with dri@@ ll@@ ers and machines .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
we want to create mass car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
we have the passion of a di@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ inno@@ v@@ ator .
she bar@@ ely brea@@ thing , and she was gone blue .
this is the kind of edu@@ cational sh@@ ame .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
if you want , it creates hyper@@ links between the images .
now you know what the answer to that question ?
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
the first question is , are we too many ?
but you won &apos;t replace phosp@@ hor@@ us .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i &apos;ve got to say .
so we &apos;re walking from front of it , and where are we going going ?
and some of them has worked and some of it .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
the people in the side rooms are coming in right now .
i agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
would you like to become more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
the dog ! i was l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic before nei@@ vy .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is totally totally r@@ ated .
it was &quot; in forever , forever . &quot;
a little more about you , not you .
and what was that for you ? what it successful ?
we &apos;re right now far away from that goal .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
the under@@ water part comes from a quar@@ ry .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
the child in me is really excited about these kinds of possibilities .
the question of death pen@@ al@@ ty is an interesting question .
it seems important to uni@@ te both .
there &apos;s a program that some may know .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
and we often rein@@ vent ourselves as we want .
then i say , he@@ art@@ c contribu@@ tion , right ?
have a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of this .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a saying about reality .
the main problem here is like aids .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , patent stuff .
and then the same , it was after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of human life .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bor@@ d@@ staf@@ f anymore .
these are the people who shape my world@@ view .
my mother suff@@ ered from dreams of the boat .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of are not quite yet .
you know , in 18@@ 35 , he was here .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for re@@ ception here .
and , lu@@ ck@@ ily , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot;
this player is just before an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
these results were achie@@ ved for several weeks of hard work .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
it also shows in other places of the book .
and i went over and i just listen@@ ed .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
li@@ ke@@ wise , i think we put games today .
... could you just show slide slide .
you can say things that affect worldwide .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
and we learn trust and the rules of play .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
the lo@@ gic does no saying what &apos;s true .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
what &apos;s rema@@ yed with us is the story@@ model .
we can continue these things in different examples .
do that , and then experience the sentence .
now this should actually be a jo@@ ke now , but .
so please listen when a music is played .
and that &apos;s just mr. the message .
how many would choose good memory ?
imagine imagine two little changes .
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
well , it turns out that you &apos;re right .
so , go out and start inv@@ enting .
go and leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot;
his whole process has changed after@@ that .
and we can like to look at this now .
that means the ants wei@@ gh much more than us .
this is the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
so you could probably feel about selling it .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ grade the destruction .
so my way of making films completely .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here are some natural flies .
because they have special cap@@ abilities of the process comp@@ ani@@ on .
we called it the digital water of pa@@ vil@@ li@@ on .
there are some places we can turn to .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
it &apos;s wor@@ ries and strange programs .
i said , &quot; promis@@ , om@@ a . &quot;
it &apos;s a totally den@@ ial of mistakes .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
i &apos;m looking forward to conver@@ sa@@ tions with all of you .
and the third area , it actually explains itself by itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
there &apos;s no over@@ population problem in trees .
&quot; look at your trees , p@@ ink .
you have to be willing to take risks .
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
and i took a while to figure this out .
we didn &apos;t have child paraly@@ sis in this country yesterday .
there &apos;s just no way getting it right .
this is one of the classi@@ c expres@@ sions in play .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom into two hal@@ cks .
this is another view of the tree of life .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue .
they moved to a kind of natur@@ ali@@ stic concept .
imagine a no@@ und@@ y airplane .
he says , &quot; make up . &quot;
so we &apos;re going to start with a windows dro@@ pp@@ er .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net doesn &apos;t do anything .
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic .
how much money takes to realize that ?
you can look around all these muse@@ ums here .
you zo@@ om in . you can actually go in .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le bits .
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s were cho@@ .
and we made an i@@ pad ap@@ p .
so he got citizens check them .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so these women met and just talked .
i think that &apos;s true of every human being on the planet .
child mortality has re@@ duced by tent@@ h of a th .
we dance in the temp@@ le and we become god . &quot;
but these are all the streets in the u.@@ a .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
we re@@ constru@@ cted it , re@@ i@@ ed it .
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a pretty .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
it gro@@ ws in the winter , and it s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in summer .
but the volu@@ me are much greater than ever before .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
i can &apos;t say it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m just going to show you just the new york times website .
so , climate change change will be terrible to you .
those who make scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i mean , this &apos;s a real cognitive tra@@ p .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
they teach them to open do@@ ors .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
if you give something , give it now .
play is the ti@@ t that kee@@ ps us together .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : hu@@ g your inner child .
you can move inside and different kinds of experiences .
i said , &quot; please fly to air . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bom@@ b .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
this is the con@@ sequence we face .
this was the most beautiful day of my life .
or are you more like a down@@ down at@@ tri@@ te ?
i don &apos;t see a reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ an@@ ade .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
and i see the same process combin@@ ing photos .
so in other words , i define what i want .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
and she said the three words : remember ?
the grand@@ father of this old man re@@ f@@ used .
you get a model that emer@@ ges of all over the earth .
and it &apos;s also ro@@ ot@@ ed deep in our lives .
you may have heard that we built water@@ sig@@ ns .
we &apos;re now foc@@ using on fu@@ els of the fourth generation .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its percei@@ ve each other .
every society is sha@@ ped by a primary medium .
so how do we work if we look inside there ?
so that &apos;s there , that is coming back .
how can i make something us@@ user friend@@ ly ?
and less us@@ able or useful it is .
it &apos;s the form of re@@ four behavior , right ?
i &apos;m never going to play the way i do at that moment .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learned to sing@@ ing ?
and even , you work much less than me .
because artists have a dist@@ ur@@ bed ra@@ ti@@ o to lie .
we went back to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
and also , the energy cycle for them is very important .
where &apos;s the greatest interest in really doing this ?
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
we walk into the arms of the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
mani@@ ok is something half a billion people eat .
the living itself doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice .
i mean , i r@@ ely seen flat lines .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
as a result , we &apos;re building stron@@ ger social relationships .
and these were sort of the first human@@ -@@ developed game devices .
it was an extreme situation . needed an extreme solution .
here &apos;s the current version of this talk .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open do@@ ors ?
and no , it &apos;s not burning man or san francisco .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girl .
so gender gender can occu@@ r in many different var@@ ie@@ ties .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment the head push .
well , the next day , we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with it .
are you ei@@ gh@@ ful and demon@@ wn like 00@@ 7 ?
we should put the bear in the c@@ age .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular fri@@ day ?
this year it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so the occu@@ py@@ thes@@ ec@@ movement has done it .
at one point the screen fil@@ ls with leaves .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
he described one of them as very common . &quot;
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of too many choices .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the auto@@ ma@@ tion .
i &apos;d like to keep doing this work that i love .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and &quot; ol@@ Ã© ! &quot; for for , despite all of this .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ board man@@ t .
as i said , two ##AT##-##AT## @@ thousand s it just started .
there &apos;s more like my glas@@ ses .
because we don &apos;t we don &apos;t make things free of it .
in fact , the notes are very v@@ age and in@@ accu@@ rate .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can di@@ ve in in a decade .
and i say , &quot; save yourself .
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
the biggest difference between them is over time .
right now , we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a econom@@ scientist .
so i say , let &apos;s the worl@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ changing games start .
is it yellow for others , or is it affec@@ ting us ?
it steel every five hope from my consciousness .
now chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
how do you ju@@ dge people because of their character properties ?
fr@@ ance makes a gate . it@@ al@@ y makes a gate .
well , today we know about where our things come from .
well , we introduced the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ hole .
how would you change your relationships and negative energy inside ?
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
well , there are not several thousand goals in this area .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever ever sold . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great b@@ ges .
it &apos;s not even online . stre@@ aming .
also , urban designers and construction workers are very interested .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s still being put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the plu@@ be .
&quot; don &apos;t feel to be un@@ true .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the th@@ yl@@ pi@@ al rat@@ s .
that &apos;s great . this is where digital hits the physical .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
the cell communities started to abstra@@ ct information again .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
but i really believe that after us , something &apos;s going on .
30 years ago , this would have ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
now it &apos;s on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
we had no words for what we started .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
and the question is , are this good news or bad news ?
you don &apos;t know it possible in this fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ what &apos;s there in a moment .
a research se@@ me@@ ster for natural user design .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
i &apos;m going to take it for you and then explain it .
this const@@ ant feedback is not in real life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as other br@@ ands .
what me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ sis have you through ?
so you just go to google proje@@ ct@@ .com .
we know one more where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
the next step was to find the app@@ s for this .
here it says , &quot; put your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so growth rate itself is acceler@@ ating .
in both cases , they was oper@@ ated , and they were fine .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
many of you are covered by faces and etc .
no , the thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn around .
i sell museum animals all over the country , worldwide .
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
now , how do people die in a result of a like this ?
these are spaces that can respond respond to a human .
that &apos;s why think about the wei@@ gh to think .
a manhattan manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
1@@ m is the highest thing i saw .
i &apos;m going to hold the kni@@ fe just like way .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for remem@@ ber@@ ing itself .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but not a response to that .
both cases na@@ nat@@ to me , and they would ged me .
i can &apos;t play today today 20 20 years .
this is the most difficult part , by the way , in my talk .
so if kl@@ aus says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
i was actually quite obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep sea .
many are talking about an 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 .
we were just ing ing there there as it else .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
so that &apos;s lar@@ gely our goal .
when we start thinking about this , that changes everything .
as a child , i was constantly drawing com@@ ic books and stuff .
over the course of this discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
our steps in di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life were exponenti@@ al .
we have an abstra@@ ct an abstra@@ ct language .
an@@ wal@@ t : i &apos;m a law@@ brand .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious .
but for the two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and of course also , how does design take influence on perception ?
so how does a human deal with certain things appropri@@ ingly ?
that means that crimin@@ crime rates go back .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
there he was w@@ bled and said , right ?
i mean , you know , choose your own list .
i worked in a co@@ h@@ le@@ min@@ station -- dangerous .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
it pay attention to crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
she could happen within a time frame@@ work .
and yet there &apos;s this mental connection .
they put it to the venti@@ atory machine .
she had suff@@ ered un@@ treat@@ able brain damage .
instead , there &apos;s a political debate argument in our country .
what &apos;s the gene called called machine age .
just as it used to happen accor@@ d@@ ingly in the village .
all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
ask questions , ask for evidence , demand evidence .
i know what people think when you see that .
ok , think of this as an extreme self ##AT##-##AT## @@ motiv@@ ation .
but we know very little about where things go .
there &apos;s even more behind it , it &apos;s going even deeper .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cross against drugs .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
and the fish was also fortun@@ enough to be there there .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
fro@@ sty , carbon gets cle@@ aner every day .
re@@ store america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described on .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
because you know , this is a funny process .
i was there not long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , wasn &apos;t h@@ unt , that was real .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advan@@ ces .
that &apos;s great . i love plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
we can put this time machine to everything we want .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
and this is actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
but actually , it was an even bigger fun that night .
the idea is to list a digital security system .
click , and bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
because the pictures made it feel real for them .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
but combin@@ ed , can you create something special like this .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
rat ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
we see the process that fe@@ e@@ ds itself on itself .
it slo@@ ws down any of our big problems .
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to honor ?
well , because you don &apos;t know that once it was different .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication .
it was called the auto@@ matically connected stone .
we had to worry worried because of the law@@ yers and so on .
it caused huge che@@ ws in the control room .
it &apos;s like asking someone to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
so i know from some who haven &apos;t met .
a a baby takes about six thousand thousand wind@@ a@@ pers .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really going to be serious ?
he only lived nin@@ and 30 years .
because the music instrument is the exten@@ sion of our body .
but it wasn &apos;t that case in the 198@@ 0s .
and then then did a lot of simu@@ lations .
and so he es@@ es@@ out of his ag@@ oni@@ zing states .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
it &apos;s this piece ing , coo@@ sen taste .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a spon@@ ge .
this is not business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i &apos;m going to step back , and i explore the way of view .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
well , the energy cycle has fallen over time .
this is a version of one thing done .
di@@ ph@@ try , tu@@ dd@@ s , child paraly@@ sis ...
you can just call some names and people will understand .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
can you imagine something good coming of to@@ bac@@ co ?
in other words , play is our adap@@ tation jo@@ ker .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
if we build cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
we can do the same things with less energy .
so better soon we should figure out what the goal is .
i fil@@ med in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush stri@@ kes ?
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
as you can see , these are not three special images .
i &apos;m always going to start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
so in a sense , technology blo@@ ps us .
she was a bra@@ ve , strong woman , she had an effect .
my grand@@ father was in ja@@ il during the pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
the bro@@ b@@ les still describe them as un@@ tou@@ ched .
a few years ago , i started to develop li@@ tt@@ vi@@ its .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to ad@@ mit that that &apos;s a big choice .
why do they adverti@@ around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it &apos;s also my great , li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
and the predic@@ tions as you read it are serious .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and we &apos;re also han@@ on very , very strong on stories .
this is the time you fall in love .
and because we get older , the wind@@ a@@ pers get bigger of that .
it &apos;s not just a nice so@@ und@@ pe@@ te .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thank you .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s honest .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
this is an i@@ dio@@ debate . it has to stop .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption of what &apos;s going on here .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive fall .
i mean , how much do we from our memor@@ ies ?
and that &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so he &apos;s logi@@ cal .
we need to start turning real world into play .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
i i like to s@@ mile and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
imagine these could actually start flying .
one friend my friends did it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
you could also use ordinary technology to spread .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you know , we hear a whole lot about transpar@@ ency transpar@@ ency .
open the map , and jump it with a click .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ction .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
but my logi@@ cal side didn &apos;t like it either .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried that you &apos;re losing re@@ gal@@ ons .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
if one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
let &apos;s take the animal beginn@@ cher , it costs a lot of money .
what &apos;s this new state that the world is starting to take ?
in fact , we &apos;re also such multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular community .
my grandmother was strong , but she was lo@@ ving as well .
my un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ mic diseases .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to pre@@ p@@ are against in@@ justice .
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its to design schools .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank gr@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
i just want to say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t . &quot;
and the oil going to be able to replace with other energy car@@ ec@@ tors .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
and then i think immediately , that &apos;s fair .
so the p@@ ink the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el and he no@@ d .
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for fla@@ vor as well .
so there should better be a nine at the beginning of my death rate .
this is a lot of dea@@ ths by mas@@ ers , 20 an hour .
i mean , ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
but it turns out that &apos;s not all yet .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you very much .
the more money you make , the more happy you are .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
just that i think he like it , right ?
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
and the film will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie from stat@@ board .
this is what i have . first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of that .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
for example , would this be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
secon@@ dly , combin@@ ed photos should have the same way of ligh@@ ting ination .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might see .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has magic forces .
ten minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a break .
that our survival is connected to survival of each individual .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat well .
but can you do , if you yourself into a foreign tch ?
somewhere here are a number of photographs -- here they are .
this is the publi@@ cation we just finished recently .
this is 20 feet sea level , like green@@ land .
we &apos;ve moved before in what &apos;s called the a@@ &apos;s age before .
i can say , the can@@ z@@ ler is a man .
he has a 15 to 15 to one .
here &apos;s a picture of an place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
a very specific wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
well , your survi@@ vor@@ s itself is not going to get happ@@ ier .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ for anyone here in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all kinds of recogni@@ tion .
this approach is true of everything new that we do crea@@ tively .
it was completely ex@@ clu@@ that she could fail .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding you this morning , &quot; he said .
and they took the way through the rest of the book .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
in 2010 , we had just connected connected under two billion people online .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat beat 300 .
and all the time , i colle@@ cted more and more knowledge .
i studied m@@ s. prin@@ ter , and she was in brea@@ th@@ thing .
and this was the first time i learned this .
i know it was the reason of the sea .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange .
we &apos;ve been using in h@@ oll@@ and over three years .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
yeah , this is what it looks like down there is the bur@@ den .
and immediately i see another pattern that comes up .
so that really me out , and i wanted more .
the fact is that this un@@ certain@@ ty should worry about .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ins in the par@@ ad@@ ise .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
they interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
there &apos;s a lot of more left , but i &apos;m missing the time .
each of these top@@ mes , of course , made of many , many smaller decisions .
and this video was actually finished in janu@@ ary .
and the next interesting stage took about a billion years .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
even who kill@@ s somebody is not just a mur@@ derer .
a few months went over , and i had just for@@ gotten everything .
depen@@ ding on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
one con@@ sequence was that the phone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
that &apos;s how how people in the west have spent a long time , thought about creativity .
and all of a sudden , it didn no longer seem to ely human .
this is how the same bad team became one under the best .
how can we trans@@ mit those feelings from play into reality ?
players are ma@@ sters in the spi@@ ders of den@@ se social nets .
if you &apos;re happy , you attra@@ ct other happy people .
obviously , that &apos;s not all going to fit into my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
and i &apos;m celebra@@ ating , i &apos;m cr@@ ying like a little child .
and the open i talked , the more i should tell .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
and of course , it can never be in germany . &quot;
that &apos;s it of of all all in the wind phase .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents all died when they were 60 .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s part of that .
or do you want to be fit@@ ter , stron@@ ger , have more power .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
an amazing er@@ ror rate . one in nine is inno@@ cent .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t get blind .
in they are , they want to go to the end of the gang .
i had a 14@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old , poor black boy as a mand@@ ent .
we &apos;ve been used to things things happen lin@@ ear .
this is somebody by by the way , hits four from 10 .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you &apos;re actually wit@@ ness of a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
this is what i want to present you with two , maybe three examples as well .
you can throw them away where you go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire@@ men .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no sou@@ l .
wel@@ wel@@ come the fear . wel@@ come the risk .
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
they did that by ir@@ ri@@ ting the country .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so the device you see there didn &apos;t work .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
the things that are only used go into technical systems .
and when i turn around , finger changes its position .
are you so far ? they look a little bit nervous .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
so if you could please turn the light back .
then let &apos;s project this analog@@ y into the future .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ dollar brand .
so nothing has changed , and yet everything changed .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
second , what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ tun@@ a costs .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to cut down so much .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
we see this that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
there &apos;s the one one a direct re@@ nam@@ m system .
now , how do you start the language of music ?
that lo@@ ses half of his value in the first year .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
we &apos;re talking about the es@@ h of information .
and i convinced them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
it has moments moments of life , one after a other .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
it looks like ol@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ bly language .
and what he noticed was that i needed an exper@@ t .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s looking at this video .
and of right , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
raising software usually takes a few years .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is happening .
we need to rely on government machine ery .
the cost of solar energy dro@@ pped by 50 percent last year .
i sent them home without talking to my top doctor .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
and i guess many of you have done too .
i believe it , and i feel like we should teach this .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it still smell good .
how many do@@ ors has the house you live in ?
and another example is the ambi@@ , intelligent systems .
but our our perception ourselves , how do they dec@@ ei@@ ve us ?
that &apos;s why they help , ask about people .
i &apos;m expla@@ to play what these notes might have to mean .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with insu@@ lin .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 is ? what do you feed ? &quot;
he said he don &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask .
depen@@ heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . our health care system is mi@@ es .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we did all this .
and this is a little bit hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
if we looked at how feelings vari@@ ate with income .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game .
again , what potential do we want to call ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , you bu@@ ried it .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
so they &apos;re moving around and they &apos;re making art instal@@ lations like this .
the previous example was about finding details .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly amazing .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal side is saying .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
a typical wal@@ -@@ m@@ art now off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure pleasure on something , we do it .
i knew she came to leave .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
because your life depen@@ ded on doing the job right .
because all of these new technologies today are eding on themselves .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i went home on my way through the emergen@@ cy department .
i was sho@@ cked and dis@@ placed into the inside .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
as it turns out dna syn@@ syn@@ thetic is very hard .
i started to think , i should just let the project in .
but so far , i going to do it a little bit curious .
and first of all , is ask what the right thing is .
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fa@@ ke you .
this first one , this was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
a fish el@@ ev@@ ing , but also a a@@ vi@@ an reser@@ ve .
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p ##AT##-##AT## @@ b@@ step gui@@ dance there .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next few days .
what it had ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
now , the memory itself is a story@@ t@@ eller .
we think about our future as seen memor@@ ies .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
most of my activi@@ ties , i have two hi@@ ts .
you see the person who wonder@@ wondering what &apos;s going on on inside .
i want to show you the lat@@ est project working on .
it ra@@ about 120 feet out of water , or 40 meters .
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
that kee@@ ps us going , and lets us always develop .
re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is part of life .
the pilot built the machine after hu@@ d@@ son river .
i haven no longer argu@@ argu@@ myself for two years with my wife .
so the force behind this is cyber@@ ber super@@ power .
so , my gentle@@ man , can you help me ? i need help .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re doing on a typical day ?
and we found that there was actually a cor@@ relation .
the words , so long his friends , now ken him .
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on their own .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that formed their life .
more and more people came in just because they were an@@ gry .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous los@@ ses .
they add a blue one to a green one , and you can make light .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
she said it would be like a th@@ n@@ ic train out of air .
what do i look like i just writing a song ?
so if i put them next to each other , that &apos;ll make your interest .
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
so , for example , push the environment , drive less car .
of course , we can look at the waste problem of course .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind@@ a@@ ls ?
so again , in every store , you can get things back .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ ys ?
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of very , a lot of ideas .
you can test it in your rooms after my talk .
the question is , can you get that to zero ?
did a single in the audience ever ever seen anyone die of mas@@ ers ?
please don &apos;t tell me these things don &apos;t have consequences .
most of you are completely ignor@@ ed by themselves .
so you can ask : how happy is the living itself ?
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
just to pre@@ cise points of time , you agre@@ agree .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
so today , evolution can happen in time period micro@@ seconds .
so now we &apos;ve blo@@ w the sc@@ ales up .
i thought technology should make magic possible and not kill .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to conclu@@ de .
i want to close with a story that really exc@@ ites me .
because through marine prote@@ cted areas , we &apos;re basically making the past .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e ##AT##-##AT## @@ book .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of most coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful mountain wor@@ ker is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
if we do it , we can protect a little back .
when you walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
you make the mistake now , and you pay much later .
usually , most people are starting to ori@@ ent themselves in terms of the task .
they dar@@ apo@@ their ur@@ g@@ ine . they almost almost never do .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the survi@@ vor@@ s itself .
this will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
this is an amazing ad@@ vent@@ ure you go to .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
think of this as an image , a flying ima@@ point .
so the a@@ wards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one to talk to the planes .
but in my humanity , i also gave my e@@ go room .
almost as like we were prepar@@ ing for our lives for it .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just like that .
you have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to completely design your car .
but where would the next a@@ ed be to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
we all need to ultimately believe things we can &apos;t see .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just just coming out of our heads .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
that &apos;s where we &apos;re cases like the one of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive need .
this is a whole book , an example of non ##AT##-##AT## @@ image data .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ impro@@ vement re@@ view .
we take pictures of these mini@@ -@@ big bang into dete@@ c@@ tors .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
then the same thing happens as in a good , brilliant conversation .
because he doesn &apos;t know what ha@@ st@@ le to go first .
let &apos;s call it mi@@ gu@@ el . it &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
here he &apos;s high@@ f@@ ting up a rare gli@@ ta@@ ar .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
and as general term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
i mean , what does someone so many out@@ f@@ its ?
that is the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
i realized the mira@@ cle in part , not not to die that day .
i really like your kind , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
so you see , this film we wanted to tell the real version .
i think they don &apos;t even coming from the muse@@ ums .
car colors , outside color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 possibilities .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
i &apos;m not not going to take all of you on this journey .
the less i think about it , the more tive it is .
we could reduce that , of course , by 10 percent , but what does it do ?
that means we &apos;re useful , not less har@@ m@@ ful about this .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the orig@@ ter .
they today have a rene@@ w@@ able energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
and this is value of this experience , so simple exercise .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
and if you can , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we keep continue , and we talk to and@@ ro@@ gens .
temp@@ t will be part of the show , which is pretty slow off .
let &apos;s just jump to mom@@ a , again in new york .
how did he get looking for help in this particular way ?
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
w@@ r want to help people who have been inno@@ cent con@@ vi@@ cted .
and i thought it gets hard hard so pain@@ ful .
this is technologi@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ suppor@@ ted innovation that is available today .
and the best part of it is perhaps what expected us in the field of health .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
i want to help you a very aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
i take brea@@ thing the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ conscious .
now he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
usually you &apos;re of just wrong , and some come , some don &apos;t .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that suppor@@ ts .
they &apos;re invest@@ ing lot of their time in assem@@ bling ever@@ increasing growing structures .
the first of these fall is a con@@ pi@@ ra@@ ration to ad@@ mit complexity .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are our next living relative with chimpanze@@ es .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to the &apos;s room .
you go to the block and you take it as an re@@ vel@@ ation .
but i don &apos;t know how reci@@ pi@@ ent people are going to be .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black .
here &apos;s the pro@@ of , by the way , that men are not pig@@ s .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
ce@@ os are a little bit bit average . but this is where it gets interesting .
because frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play play with me .
and i really want to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a law@@ yer .
the ju@@ dge thinks of him as an adult , but i see a child .
and within a few years , le@@ go moved to every hou@@ se@@ hold .
here i &apos;m zo@@ and@@ ing it a bit . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
so i decided when i was 15 to become a di@@ ver .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
: social dec@@ line . er 7 : 65 dead .

fire@@ flies in a glass always found quite exciting .
from my eye angle , i saw the jan@@ it@@ or up and down .
the x ##AT##-##AT## @@ unique interpretation of a piece is compar@@ able to this .
in many , you &apos;ll say they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
a long time ago , there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales -- 500 years ago .
that means the gam@@ player is certainly going to beat out of 10 stri@@ ats .
and they did this with what &apos;s called le@@ ad@@ -@@ landscap@@ es .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
okay , let me squ@@ ush a little blood blood out for you .
imagine that every single one is controlled by people .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
how about contribu@@ tions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
but instead of pan@@ ic , he just stopped .
and that &apos;s what i had half a year .
but somehow we can to move ourselves from this problem .
he invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
it means that we achie@@ ved a cultural impact next to the scientific .
and these are now just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers now , the individual people .
so i &apos;ve been doing this , when is what of natural or intui@@ tive ?
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s true .
i ate it in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
what about paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s that . why not ?
we hate too strong government . we have no trust in the system .
we use games to get suffering of the real world .
we de@@ gra@@ end a human who has value for our society .
we en@@ l@@ ed to his bed so that he can see outside .
here &apos;s an clip from this attac@@ king code .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so maybe you should go a little bit about this before the interview . &quot;
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
i like things that strange . i like strange things .
even this air@@ port has a surface of 100 square kilometers .

well , in fact , the number of non@@ cri@@ mes hasn &apos;t changed very much .

and if we can do that , can we laun@@ ch the chromo@@ some ?
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
this has &apos;t &apos;t taken form two and a thousand eight , shape , these networks .
i think sort of about six dollars or something like that .
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow ha@@ ck .
that goes much further back to the cultures of pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial times .
and six@@ 10 milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
no longer longer need to whi@@ le or sing a love one .
of that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you may know .
there was the core cle@@ i facili@@ ty of le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen .
i asked him how he turned to a fish exper@@ t like this .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s self ##AT##-##AT## @@ excited .
well , i wonder@@ ed , how can i actually get over ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
well , the survi@@ vor@@ s itself is living his life life continu@@ ously .
well , the two kinds of self thro@@ up two terms of happiness .
our gut is a wonder@@ fully fully friend@@ ly environment for these bacteria .
but a lot of people are ve in a very strange position .
i brought seven few under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange land@@ way .
so it turns out very hard to get all these exten@@ sions .
the greatest fear they had pir@@ rate , ra@@ pe and death .
photos like this : construction site along a much remote road .
somebody had broken in , and had ha@@ cked the system th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world view .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all miner@@ al benefits .
is it also clear that the answer to the question is it .
they increase paraly@@ sis and lower happiness .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
and , i think , was a very good code .
the interesting thing about this is , once i can make a little trip .
and i &apos;m not as sure if you &apos;re really going to be there .
the components becomes increasingly become a friend to live with .
so finally , here was a company trying to do it right .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build exten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ se .
i grew up with a loved science fi@@ ction .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
they produced the highest construction in the lo@@ west time .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
this is actually the true mel@@ ting of humans and machine .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebra@@ te .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represent ?
an remarkable , play@@ ful brand . what &apos;s her brand ?
finally , in the pro@@ gr@@ ing , we should wel@@ wel@@ come the fear .
so a few years ago , i i went to do that .
opportunities that wouldn &apos;t have allowed allowed were ex@@ encoura@@ sed .
for example , the fish was taken on a glass trip .
so find programs that can most sort numbers .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
how can a ju@@ dge turn into something they &apos;re not ?
how about a set of new , never heard voices ?
basically , the con@@ cre@@ te building block had become the building block of our time .
5@@ 4 percent of dea@@ ths happened by dri@@ ll@@ ing .
the modern industrial world as we know it is har@@ dly 300 years old .
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
at the last ted conference , i gave an introdu@@ to the l@@ h@@ c .
and that &apos;s where we worked out a co@@ de ##AT##-##AT## @@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ condu@@ ct .
so this is just one app@@ lic@@ ation of many you can do with this .
that means you navi@@ gate ated over sound and about rhyth@@ m .
then these are per@@ verb@@ al influ@@ pac@@ ts of the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industri@@ industrial cultures .
the not@@ notes notes have the function of the letters of a scri@@ pt .
so i ask , how compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
this is a fish es@@ cape in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables , as they &apos;re often called .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
now , what does this have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
my inspiration comes from an event that goes back 2,@@ 500 years .
ah , most people . i like to read that , as a doctor .
but nothing was invented that would let me go , until now .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , really changed my life .
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
what is this about the thought and feelings about yourself ?
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed photos should have the same perspective .
this is my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ age . a very simple thing .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
a child in india says , &quot; today i saw a mon@@ key . &quot;
i gave some talks in germany about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
so the the dra@@ matic high numbers in the prison in@@ mates .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular scale .
i looked into the ro@@ cks , and it was a little bit p@@ ink .
some of my clo@@ p@@ se happened over the last five years .
and best best all is they connect with magne@@ ts .
and the critical indi@@ c@@ ator of this is the extin@@ ction of the languages .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
this is now even live on the internet . you can check it .
most people most people know this from the software area .
even if you were sho@@ ot yourself , you would have emissions .
you learn to find the notes to the notes on the instrument .
there was no piano at the time b@@ ach@@ s as an instrument at no instrument .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful there .
so i off@@ ered $ 100,000 software prize for the w@@ inner .
so i want this machine , and i want to go to the future .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about gene@@ tically changed food .
it &apos;s in the present right now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph@@ .@@ d. student .
we become collabor@@ ative thinking , heart beings .
and this is called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists that there &apos;s &apos;t exist this test .
we find other od@@ ari@@ ties about what your rights are .
so all these green areas , these are the tar@@ ge@@ ted environments .
these people will be connected to the movie forever forever for forever .
it actually actually inclu@@ des a time period of two ##AT##-##AT## @@ and a half weeks .
well , finally , the film requires a very big moment@@ um .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted .
and it &apos;s spread exc@@ tion@@ less , organ@@ ically , of course .
and so i think the ted community should be bra@@ per .
if somebody lies , they &apos;s not just just a li@@ ar .
i think in too many places opposite of poverty is justice .
you know what a 3@@ 3,000 ter in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
by end mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be re@@ func@@ able .
this is our yo@@ unger bed@@ test ster there on the right .
this is the period of the most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
if we actually don &apos;t take a phosp@@ hor@@ us and give off .
and somehow , we need to create changes that are going to down to zero .
the people here have contribu@@ ted to a lot of these wonder@@ s to the development .
speci@@ alized skills and process skills and their combin@@ ation lead to success .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you have to go to the house .
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
and so we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
so if we do the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
and just all these companies disappe@@ ared , one after the time .
if they could do it for them , you could help me too .
but on youtube , more than 4@@ 8 hours of video is u@@ plo@@ aded a minute .
this piece 50 year ##AT##-##AT## old technology became the most gical thing for me .
it &apos;s about creating ab@@ und@@ ance of ar@@ ce goods .
and i was good , i gradu@@ ated with c@@ um lau@@ de .
and when i listen@@ to her , she made rock@@ que sounds .
we &apos;ve spread li@@ vi@@ its to kids , and we see them play with it .
on september 10@@ th , last year , the machine first on for the first time .
what were its circum@@ stances like society and politics ?
oud and gui@@ mar@@ ns , f and b , etc , etc .
the human is supposed to come from the mon@@ key or have a common ance@@ st@@ or .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vi@@ o@@ lin conc@@ ert .
and this is something we need to learn , which is very quickly .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish a fish the same rights as a human .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology ?
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ y sounds and a stuff like that .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
three months later , i moved around and the ad@@ vent@@ ure went on .
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
i love this : &quot; wat@@ son forces human ene@@ my . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevi@@ table .
i don &apos;t know what you think me , but i can live with it .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you afraid afraid never succe@@ ed ?
this is where the the more you do , the better .
so play together ables you to grow of ties , trust and each other .
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more will be possible .
i think mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation have changed fundament@@ ally changed our world .
but at the same time , we need a good fra@@ ction of intuition to actually ec@@ ute the experiments .
she said , &quot; this is going to make you very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
in the short time here , i realized : ted has an identity .
i got into the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve lost god a piece of far far to virtual .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , come back .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
tsun@@ am@@ i@@ war@@ ning . speak@@ nine : cyber@@ ber attac@@ .
because these would be just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
often the music class is like you learn to read the notes .
just if it seems har@@ dly in@@ appropriate , maybe play &apos;s the most necessary .
so there &apos;s all this dr@@ um in front of the un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be as little bad .
nam@@ is to lie that you can just apply this lo@@ gic wrong .
just trade trade the construction of homes against cities .
we live on a planet covered 70 percent covered with water .
&quot; remember the patient sent home ? &quot;
the offi@@ cial rate of all western industri@@ alized societies .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it . &quot;
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it get us ?
you can only have zer@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ le@@ mis@@ sions if you &apos;re not there .
but when i ask you , how do you do with your wife ?
that was the very first beginning of own musical expression .
because a good engineer built either great cars or nuclear power plants .
it is naturally from asia , in the case from japan .
this &apos;s where what enormous spee@@ speed possibilities are there .
tons of studies have been done to see if that was true .
and i tend to see ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence as my sha@@ do@@ ws .
we should be be able to a@@ dic@@ ate everything we want .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so i sat down , and you played the ted@@ talk .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to keep them apart .
but it does something that does no other government technology .
they say that you never forget the names of those who die .
but what if the image connected you to all your images ?
by now , a lot of people working with , and they can all be enga@@ ged .
you collect information about the piece in the secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
listen consci@@ ously and say if you taste it or not .
so why do i ask from my audience that it &apos;s ac@@ tively as well ?
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is gone .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before something comes into the body .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ tical industry .
under a hat , i work with the history of an@@ atom@@ y .
it &apos;s also a re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time 3d scan and a movement shot .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
big data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world around the world .
before i close the talk , i to tell you about my grandmother .
you decided to sna@@ him free when it ra@@ ws .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and she was star@@ ing at me .
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ es on the way , nan@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ materials .
if you do re@@ inten@@ tion and never make the mistake again .
what you need is an environment that puts them in the situation .
he finished the whole process of thought , and he did something completely new .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
and that then fir@@ the words of open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
essential tool of information medi@@ ing has been since time time stories .
right directly , in this way , we can get get nutri@@ ents into agriculture .
to keep t@@ ins , right with the com@@ pos@@ er .
you learn basically first to reading before you just talk one one word .
if i don &apos;t be right , the can@@ z@@ ler is not a man .
let &apos;s start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paraly@@ sis . and you know what ?
a illusion becomes into something real because somebody percei@@ ves it like way .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we on telling stories .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in memory .
in we think at it , we got into all sorts of in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
it was as an it@@ al@@ y that won foot@@ ball world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
they knew all bits and by@@ tes that they had to attack .
and not the machine leader , nor the security system will notice it .
all par@@ ties , all the fra@@ ctions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
how good do you think , are you at dealing the decisions ?
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
we can better deal with more categ@@ ories than with more choices .
we now know nine cities planning to use this ap@@ p .
it bring pictures and text together anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
sometimes these ideas pre@@ v@@ ahead of our thinking in a very important way .
br@@ y@@ an , they really brought a string a string here .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
and this game was played by university university profess@@ ors and so on .
because it calls something that has lost lost in a way .
and this is one of the three main sources of exi@@ sting online problems today .
beyond the simple game , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is actually quite powerful .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
to put it context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
when your work fle@@ w -- not entirely entirely your er@@ ror , right ?
still still there for your contribu@@ tion , whatever it wants to be .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al was to build a lot of more carbon fac@@ tor@@ ies .
i wrote wrote four words , and i want to explain it brie@@ quickly .
and to see , how do we process@@ process information , how do we recor@@ ding information ?
you only see the sense of the letters when you can get the language to it .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and we , for a period of four and a half half , became a real family .
and this is a thought i think is appropriate .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential essential .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
we know something about what determin@@ es the happiness of happiness self .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design computer games .
they &apos;re creating an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
the human genome project started 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
so how should we oper@@ ate the question of the properties of character ?
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a talk at ted@@ global .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next satur@@ day .
and today we &apos;re all feel of of ourselves as the ow@@ ner of our pop culture .
the sm@@ work from the la@@ da@@ al elt came out of the rest of the world .
but this picture is actually completely com@@ posed from photos of different places .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and these app@@ s let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
today we can point ate to do@@ zens of companies that have done done exactly this .
and i think it &apos;s starting with a medical person , and who &apos;s me .
the reason : the government could track where a text came from .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
writing books is my prof@@ ession , but it &apos;s , of course is more than that .
and the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is a search led me to the old gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me .
and this is the core concern@@ issue of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
but now , not at the local level , but at a global level .
and the most important thing this is to look at the ground , first of all .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ to go and take the nutri@@ ents .

and then ro@@ cks hu@@ b ish , so he lo@@ m them the sight .

now this is a three ##AT##-##AT## @@ sentence here that descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic .
and if i &apos;m right , the can@@ z@@ ler is a man .
because when the water flo@@ ws out , it &apos;s dec@@ lin@@ ing in the atlan@@ tic .
and who you going on sees that this is particularly true in men .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .

he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst spi@@ ri@@ ts of humanity .
we think that we &apos;re not as good in reality as we &apos;re in games .
it &apos;s people who believe that individuals they can change the world .
if we predict , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it get us ?
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics that mov@@ moving objects feel the same .

also , t@@ &apos;s mother mother is here in the fourth or five th row .
so it &apos;s more cap@@ turing an idea than really a moment .
i &apos;m going to start showing you a single bor@@ ing slide .
the united states today have the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
these are the questions we need to deal with for the next 50 years .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see them here .

if we go back from there , what should the 20 20 stim@@ on in 20@@ 20 ?
now , this &apos;s three weeks , and this is highest one and a half hours .
i grew up with a mother who taught me every day .
every paraly@@ zed can actually communicate or draw with their eyes alone .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
it &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active ; it &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic active .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .

now this &apos;s fundamental al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s go through it .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wish thinking .
the kni@@ fe you can look at , my hand can study .

of course , a lot of people , scientists , will con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
they also had to regi@@ ster a piece of un@@ ce@@ d@@ text from this ty@@ pe@@ writer .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life .
a piece of art you never look at has no power to work .
it &apos;s just to see when you go one step and look at the whole thing .
so we can now jump and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ inner .
and so i want to show you what might be a little surprise .
and it si@@ sitting there burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .

so i want to show you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
because in fact , we have to prove if there &apos;s the sou@@ l or not .
different speak@@ ers : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
america provi@@ ds 100 percent clean electricity over the next 10 years .
you &apos;ve ever heard of this about over@@ population problems of trees ?
the sou@@ l is such kind of ritual , it &apos;s like lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
if you te@@ ar that down somewhere , it takes take a while .
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
imagine a big explosion as you get up to 1,000 meters .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a ground wave .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equ@@ probably the biggest problem .
so the alli@@ ance of climate protection has started two campaig@@ ns .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , feedback , vision .
there will be a lot of resi@@ stance and argu@@ er .
it &apos;s not about pus@@ genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and he said , &quot; well , you could &apos;t remember me .
they probably even knew the size of the machine service .
people are always wor@@ worried when i say , &quot; con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts . &quot;
conver@@ connect at the top of the ur@@ ur@@ e@@ sive nasa image .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world over the last generation .
what has influ@@ ences on our thinking and on our memory ?
in the ground , over 40 percent of the carbon is stor@@ ed .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
you don &apos;t need to make music anymore if it gets bor@@ ed you .
so i called the next day just before the event , don .
a friend journalist had been talking about this fish for long time .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i jo@@ ined these expedi@@ tions .
tons of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
are we in of of evolutionary balance in the form of a species ?
so sex games are common , both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans .
and this gave us a lot of confidence of what we were looking at here .
he typ@@ ps &quot; mar@@ su@@ al rat &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i still have time to show you other environments .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for yourself .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement you can do about your life &apos;s work .
in fact , sometimes he can feel feel par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
but when you se@@ al , most most drin@@ king water will fall away .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and fil@@ ters .
but why don &apos;t we sing@@ ing anymore to get from from top to b to b ?
many use the word , but they don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
we make agriculture in brazil from where we re@@ gain the nutri@@ ents .
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c is a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ies .
all of this affec@@ ts me , and all of this also affec@@ ts my experience with the com@@ position .
i say , ul@@ f , what do you need that big car ?
it &apos;s easily check at this that it has very different in mind .
who can make a fish taste so well after it &apos;s been coo@@ ked ?
they don &apos;t exist in a sun@@ light based system as we do that .
these were care@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , in@@ cent people .
why is it impossible in play to think you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
we developed the game super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute of the future .
and one night , there &apos;s a p@@ cking on its hotel door .
now in practice , people are not being te@@ sted on their chromo@@ some .
when all the answers were yes , i feel as if i won .
they cause something like a water cur@@ tain with water sc@@ points .
how would your mind rel@@ ate with your body being oc@@ oc@@ alized in the room ?
so if you think about ally thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s starting with the animal beginn@@ er .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve citi@@ citi@@ zen@@ ship .
this is a slide i happened to choose from my fol@@ der .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or does in the connection machine .
and we bring them back in con@@ temporary history for children .
she was something that made you always wanted to be near her .
but you can also think differently depen@@ ding on how we see our identity .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
and it worked for a while until i met prin@@ ter .
it turns out that he was a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ ck infe@@ ction .
that meant that he was immediately killed during the chinese invasi@@ on .
but the spa@@ tial order of images is actually important here .
is it possible to make these really big molecules that has never been done before ?
don &apos;t you have a fear that the hu@@ mili@@ ation of a pas@@ ement will kill you you ?
the perman@@ ant re@@ co@@ very with music today is not pro@@ mot@@ ant .
it &apos;s impossible to present these kinds of things in a society that should work .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , we enjoy . we &apos;re lo@@ ver .
so i can zo@@ om in my course in a certain time frame .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge out of it .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child against child paraly@@ sis . no way .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars on dark ur@@ ine .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , and i let it look real .
in fact , don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like humans -- love to play their life long .
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ , how can that be ? &quot;
the pilot had used the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- for happiness , for happiness .
with a big li@@ on at each , so we how we wel@@ come the risk .
it &apos;s been two cities being built in china already , and the third one is in prepar@@ ation .
go from the little choices to the many , then stay with it .
but think in a way that is integr@@ ated into our own lives .
it &apos;s not about sc@@ ar@@ city , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my upp@@ ie@@ man , he was very loved ar .
why didn &apos;t ask the top doctor ? why did i send it home ?
they weren &apos;t e@@ aten ; they thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
and then i took a sa@@ hn@@ -@@ lo@@ der and i put it to it .
then came the next generation that we actually live pri@@ mar@@ ily today .
you can only be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classi@@ cal music .
so you become audi@@ ble to what you just came up of in the mind .
and we can turn with this big battery to turn out two milli@@ seconds out .
we now have 30 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany .
this is what coming back to two billion years of labor experience .
and i can kind of cover everything i &apos;ve seen seen so far today .
i left out ti@@ als , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
he &apos;s just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus with a few virus v@@ acc@@ ine .
you can see it in a moment , but you can also see away if you want .
or , &quot; what was her journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
and cru@@ cial about this study was that the teachers were not exten@@ ded .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robot ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are least known known the pri@@ mates .
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
now i can answer all your questions and give you an extraordinary it@@ mary .
in order to go really close , you can go up to the cra@@ cks .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full ev@@ ator ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , participa@@ tion communities and the un@@ expected .
because you just do that the way you &apos;re called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain bear .
if you want to know it , these other spi@@ kes are also fri@@ days .
what scri@@ you could have have written in which you ur@@ in ?
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
a citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but the government played a central role here .
in other words , every step here is a power in performance scale .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a sla@@ ve in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in port and in ja@@ il .
but for the afri@@ can@@ american in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great che@@ ch politi@@ cian , once said .
there &apos;s a little fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the standards tation .
they &apos;re made to be light , sound , motor and sen@@ sor .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; i said , &quot; no . &quot;
this is actually a poster of not@@ re lady that was recor@@ ded right .
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece in@@ cted chemical material .
you can see in the upp@@ er field that its chromo@@ some just dro@@ ps apart .
it turned out he just wanted to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ables .
and unfortunately , didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
in part , with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so these places are in there .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
we do this in china for example example , where we take the waste directly .
as interpre@@ interpre@@ of a piece of music , i first have just the written notes .
if you build more wind force , the system starts to fail .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demon@@ stration i &apos;ve given until far .
right now , in this world , we think data is a es@@ cape .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the kni@@ fe trick .
front of him there &apos;s a beauti@@ fully d@@ ressed sho@@ w@@ girl .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
well , today , our environment , for the first time , starts respond to us .
we need to face the consequences , and we better start pre@@ p@@ are ourselves .
our politicians say , our president says , even our ce@@ os say it .
every single harvard employees now auto@@ matically join on a life fund .
because that , of course , is an picture you can &apos;t record with your camera .
and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
so this now allows allows us to work as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discus@@ sing .
the basis for a lot of this , technologies are forming , and they are growing ex@@ poten@@ tially .
he had a poten@@ tially life@@ -@@ dangerous disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to later work in africa .
in these recor@@ , there was a fol@@ der called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
lights , , sound , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
it &apos;s a bu@@ mer from pla@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ do@@ h that &apos;s afraid in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
and i promis@@ ed to come back to explain to you how the machine works .
it &apos;s not at all like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
i then say with my own words , what could be written between this sc@@ aff@@ old .
he asked me what the introdu@@ ction of this bar was for me .
so films were the way to bring images and stories together . that fit together .
and with every trial , the kids get feedback what works and what doesn &apos;t .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t this right . &quot;
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no unds there .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
democracy grew in , but at the same time , science also grew in .
we do that . as rational as we are , as much as we value intelle@@ ct .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the ris@@ ing bran@@ ch .
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that you don &apos;t do the same thing ?
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
this is not electr@@ on microscop@@ e it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ e .
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and if we can do that for w data why why not for content ?
because at some point , i had to say to myself , &quot; what am i doing here ?
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and we got the as@@ sign@@ ment designing a building in the ent@@ ance into the exp@@ o .
but the king of si@@ am got al@@ umin@@ um ta@@ cks .
and i &apos;m afraid of more more things that nobody would know .
so we were only five people at the time to re@@ build one around society .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds in this place .
and so a span@@ ish company span@@ ish company with environmental awareness bought the country .
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
and after two , three days , it realized that she was never going to wake or again .
we all know what good about it , so i &apos;ll what &apos;s bad about it .
and then it goes back back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , to be as little bad .
you can also try that in words like re@@ ven@@ ge or w@@ it@@ ction or something .
here you a little lo@@ gic , but you need the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s going fast everywhere .
co2 war@@ ms the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
and so they &apos;ve in a really wonderful way the future civil rights movement .
so we &apos;re about to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
this map gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and ser@@ ves for ori@@ entation in the rest of the book .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of rever@@ table mistakes .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
in your mind : ti@@ mel@@ ine and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood to really bring this to life ?
i &apos;m not a doctor or resear@@ cher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
he was a little dd@@ kid , and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
they come from ideas that are driven by convin@@ cing our he@@ arts .
and so we don &apos;t really really understand what meaning our actions have in the histor@@ ical context .
but even me in my ma@@ ry art , sometimes i &apos;ve reach@@ up this thing .
and these two worl@@ ds pop right together , new and old thinking .
tradition@@ ally , we think in the environmental debate we &apos;re too many in the world .
this is this lo@@ gic in this , yes , in this de@@ ting talk .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new opportunities for leaders .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
i &apos;m just going to go to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do . just do . &quot;
and now our fo@@ ei@@ ted consciousness immediately feels , and you can do something of that .
but always and always the approach that it should should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not from material , material nature .
whereas language was inter@@ or@@ dered by under@@ lower ran@@ ch .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting types ?
it color@@ ed blue because of the genes that we ad@@ ded in .
you study the works that he com@@ pos@@ posed before and after .
i wonder that you often forget something very basic .
it &apos;s evolved over evolution to look up cont@@ amin@@ ants . &quot;
this is a highly highly un@@ profit categ@@ ory sche@@ me .
a project i started out recently was to build a gen@@ e ##AT##-##AT## @@ gun .
well , they couldn &apos;t make this worked , not econom@@ ically .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear nuclear area mod@@ ular , liquid .
she &apos;s res@@ cu@@ ed my life , and my partner and i were saving y@@ ours .
when i start with the simple , i learn how i choose .
there are still in the ama@@ zon alone in still six and a half billion trees .
they grew meat c@@ attle on what were basically we@@ t@@ lands .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ di@@ ites .
so i can take a step back , and jump directly to a specific se@@ ction .
no fear , no j@@ y@@ fish , child paraly@@ sis , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ight is a fairly complicated process .
if you think you look good at something , it &apos;s almost sure like way .
now , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to talk to us back .
let &apos;s make a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ ch@@ ase of a car .
but on citizens connect is everything public so everybody can see it .
she was also the beginning of many argu@@ ments in our family .
and she believed that these were the issues that we need to take care of .
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks the world is getting worse and worse .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just kill out@@ outside with the spe@@ .
. you know , i never believed that i &apos;ll end up working at microsoft .
with your chemical block@@ block , john -- how about you ?
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
that means you can see on the internet to re@@ gain nutri@@ ents back .
and so i brought you a project that i want to introdu@@ ce you now .
now , the ber@@ ing itself makes more than to ber@@ ing and tell stories .
we can give ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence a new meaning that goes out beyond heavy times .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number are multi@@ pli@@ ing .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from an@@ atom@@ y .
and more than anything else , are you the best parents who they can only be ?
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could evidence or dis@@ prove .
and often we just ran into a dead streets and we had to re@@ ourselves .
but if it comes to it should be imple@@ mented , something changes .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive or so forth .
we told her stories , and we in@@ red them that we were still with them .
so , what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve government work .
and that &apos;s what these cells do -- that made them happy for another billion years .
that &apos;s why , for example , the suff@@ gen@@ cy gro@@ ws to antibio@@ tics .
i had something , your sister had something . go , drink a be@@ er . &quot;
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
until the &apos; 8@@ 0s , it was fis@@ hed a big style .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
i think it &apos;s better if we make our great creative to live .
this is the second largest waste flow throughout our country in america .
because they &apos;ve changed changed the head of the board now .
every time it &apos;s exciting exciting because over and again , i read something new .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
it &apos;s near the co@@ in of the river of gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
no f@@ ame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
that &apos;s me as i do the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; &quot; face .
so , again , change and custom@@ i@@ zation are the greatest greatest abilities of the human .
wi@@ oles@@ ence are made for a change that we haven &apos;t yet adap@@ ted to yet .
as con@@ sequence , the body is evol@@ evol@@ ving more following the typical female course .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day still still there .
imagine that everybody can give a little don@@ ation for an image point .
and somebody who has such an arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ d .
but it didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
i looked through the sho@@ wer wall , and saw it standing on the other side .
she said , &quot; i think you can do you want to do . &quot;
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , don &apos;t drink something . &quot;
bin laden &apos;s death takes an increas@@ ed risk risk .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ mod@@ ul@@ es that have a specific function .
chri@@ ent@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , or whatever .
i want to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
you &apos;ve recently seen cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment .
not the work itself . it was still often as dark as e@@ h and ever .
if you look at this in histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
the united states is one of the two biggest pollution , along with china .
and now i connect the fil@@ ters with the b@@ ass for a little more expression .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
because steve jobs once said , you need deeper to know how it works .
design law of ne@@ ar@@ by , the gest@@ law law of continu@@ ity and so on .
and suddenly suddenly have an interface , which is much intui@@ tive and much more natural .
and in our western world , we &apos;ve always been too stupid to bring our nutri@@ ents back .
so the baby is carb@@ carbon positive for the whole life , from the beginning beginning .
so the , the music works as similar to me as spo@@ ken language .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he came up on the table with a bright , almost sh@@ zz@@ y white color .
and if we learn knowledge , maybe we can even draw wisdom out of it .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destro@@ y it at the same time .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
not just like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little over@@ wh@@ el@@ te .
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always looking for more creativity .
okay , just just a quick example of a version of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
this is what you would , in engineering teams , a re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control system .
you see in the middle , the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um , the flow of ti@@ ver .
as a ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i brea@@ p its temporary atmosphere .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly realized that these kids actually beat something .
we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ t today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
at she was 17 , she the second woman of a mand@@ in whose mother beat her .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
so he did what good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
this is a generation that grew up with seeing her voice for gran@@ ted .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
we need to find ways to face these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
we &apos;ve te@@ pped down from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
should i mar@@ ry later ? should i first have children , or make a career first ? &quot;
this is the can@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
it &apos;s a story with an open end , and he can decide how it evol@@ evol@@ ve .
this was then tri@@ g@@ ved by ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be gri@@ mmer than trees .
on this island , this is the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ors .
it always lost three of the dies@@ els , two are always wa@@ ited .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons these are .
if you take cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re even more effective than tab@@ ills of any shape .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take sou@@ p . &quot;
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the forest of con@@ go .
and that radi@@ cally cally changes the interaction that we have have out with our environment .
but is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a difficult thing about me ?
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
one million people leave la@@ tin america every year and go to the united states .
only for about 12 percent of your decisions , they needed an hour or more of your time .
but if i could give this and certainly make it it , i would do it .
and they realized that the city never rele@@ ased this hy@@ dr@@ ant .
and most people understand that , but they think one is the input of the other .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came on de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn back .
they use online attac@@ ks to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
this is w@@ w@@ la@@ di@@ me t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin from tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
here we see , with fil@@ ce , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ die ...
it &apos;s not created a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , it creates the resol@@ ution of reality .
but if you ask the indi@@ ans , they say , &quot; the plant spea@@ talking to us . &quot;
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s being run by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
12 to 24 hours later , everything got back together as it was .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think , we &apos;re looking from front to the back .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental awareness in the south .
all right , there &apos;s the front pre@@ st@@ o , that &apos;s a quick piece .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes out of the sing@@ er and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bis@@ cho@@ fs of wor@@ che@@ ster .
she like to like him because he has a tenden@@ cy to sin@@ est@@ ity .
so the brown is sort of the conven@@ tional system , the green system is our system .
and the obser@@ vation of your team is more important than all the l@@ or@@ be@@ ans in the world .
in the sense of another self , memory self , you get a different story .
this is a player who &apos;s standing on the edge of what &apos;s called an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success 10,000 hours .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players really good at ? &quot;
there are these ancient cu@@ bes , she@@ ep needs . you know ?
they played ro@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;ll don@@ it all again .
so despite that war@@ ning , i knew that anybody was going to buy name rights .
... that doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . what kind of roll@@ roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster are you in ?
i think my personal view is very easy to expla@@ ined to this slide and your access .
it &apos;s not about what reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to take a few decades to take t .
and it par@@ tly does it with metho@@ ds , which we don &apos;t even really understand so far .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all de@@ costs don &apos;t end with ar@@ re@@ ation .
we also did something on the corner of this particular out@@ put of the guar@@ di@@ an .
they really want to make the decision cor@@ tly if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
in the areas , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the king water source for this city .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted of get closer to matter , like that .
and what are what are our values , and what are what &apos;s our pos@@ ation , is our basis ?
and you also have to do it and understand it in order to do it understand it .
so there , as a designers , i i a much more more often than it looks like .
our vo@@ cal of sing@@ sing@@ ing , our hands and feet dan@@ cing .
i allowed myself , i asked li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention it .
and i might like to imagine my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
i worked in the collective for 11 years , which was bas@@ s@@ roots democratic .
what you might be ask is , how does this ? why ? what about those ?
but that &apos;s not what this is about about now , and then i open my hand .
if you ask about the happiness of memory , it &apos;s a very different thing .
these are decisions that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , need to deal with .
i think if you keep people off , you get them fail .
well , before we started after@@ today , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
now -- we can just ski@@ p that -- i instead &apos;ll just ski@@ p the video ...
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it was a lot last febru@@ ary .
finally finally i get programs that can perfectly perfect numbers .
i thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
when they came in 100 species , dam@@ n , one of them should have been perfect .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- the question is .
you can explain explain that much better , and there &apos;s a lot more behind there .
you bring a new idea in , and that &apos;s how it ans@@ wer@@ ed to a response .
in fact , first you have you have to prove if there &apos;s such kind of freedom freedom wel@@ ness .
now i want to take this idea a little further further with is a little crazy .
because the set was an accu@@ rate copy of the plans of the ship .
now if i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
doesn &apos;t even happen in this country , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be beautiful .
and now just a little little bit through my skin and on the other side on the other hand .
oh , you know that . ok . prime . so we &apos;ve got some players here .
our ancestors used to have that hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ less loo@@ p .
nobody knew where the next life@@ -@@ saving saving ed was at this moment .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to ra@@ th@@ edi@@ users .
these little oil dro@@ p@@ let were in were the most primi@@ tive cell form .
out there on the de@@ po@@ nia , but also else in the landscape , right ?
if that happens mis@@ ror free , the student gets the next challen@@ difficult piece .
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics on the net .
and then , the next day , you would play , and on the next day you would eat .
we imagine epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies and give people the opportunity to achieve them .
i represent these children who were con@@ vi@@ cted to very hard sent@@ ish@@ .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular about wikipedia .
you talk about it , thinking what it will look like , they run around power .
that number goes up , and it &apos;s ris@@ up very quickly , and that &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
they say who has no sou@@ l who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
so the second sentence is , if sound is right , he has no sou@@ l .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to him , it &apos;s not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
and in fact , this is of at@@ at@@ data data from stu@@ x@@ net stu@@ x@@ net before .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than on both .
just like &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; it seems out out of no@@ where .
the rest of day , the night , i had this close feeling in my sto@@ mach .
it would be wor@@ d@@ less of us to do consci@@ ously and tar@@ ge@@ ted people . &quot;
you can check them less easily , yes , or or get them to fall .
man 5 : brand &apos;s al@@ co@@ hol mic scri@@ writer .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have of .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of the americans are doing this every day .
evolution pri@@ ti@@ zes the creatures that ada@@ pt best to their environment .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was ex@@ ro@@ them .
this is just the pressure and print print ped pt with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
i said , &quot; how much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot;
these are real patients under@@ a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
but the cool@@ est thing i ever worked on , it was about this guy .
and i would be happy if ce@@ g would help this do this .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s ns his work .
seven million people are rele@@ ased on cur@@ ren@@ cy or un@@ related pun@@ ish@@ lation .
so , okay , to ha@@ ck biology , you need kind of need material .
we &apos;re playing the production cost right now . no f@@ ame lan@@ track .
i &apos;m not trying to be anymore ; i decide to be happy .
we &apos;re mar@@ mar@@ ily to the limit@@ ies of biological reality and those of our imagination .
last last month , researchers ned that the entire continent now has a negative ice foot@@ print .
fro@@ sty the carbon man is a fun , happy bur@@ g .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically fe@@ asi@@ able .
why do we prevent people from knowing about something if it &apos;s true ?
no important sub@@ dea@@ vor that dem@@ ands innovation has has ever been add@@ ted without risk .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also the survival of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
the other place that was very interested in construction is sing@@ apo@@ re .
we &apos;re close to the seas@@ seas@@ on and moving towards the world c@@ up .
i had it better . all of this sele@@ ction allowed allowed me to have it better .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscop@@ e .
that &apos;s i think they &apos;re there are fewer people being put in than actually exist .
and with a kind of flas@@ h@@ light , we can these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is an es@@ el made of p@@ ure nature .
in terms of na@@ than@@ iel , the music music brought him back to a community of friends .
this is hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good follo@@ wer for the marketing . &quot;
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come an oil shor@@ tage .
i &apos;m coming back from a community that knows the secret of wealth of humanity .
i could see it in your eyes , there was terri@@ ror , life ended .
so i want to share you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ p@@ pe@@ pet are you right now ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a stupid mistake like this ?
in the united states , the medical institute gets the number at 100,000 .
this young man &apos;s young man was identi@@ fied as a follo@@ tag of the pan@@ ke lam@@ a .
this is a project photo@@ syn@@ th that conne@@ cts two different technologies .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i by microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
think of this as the sequ@@ el work by ste@@ phen law@@ &apos;s work on virtual earth .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
these wir@@ es make 13@@ thousand am@@ pe@@ mers when the machine to high ##AT##-##AT## @@ performance .
the next generation of graphic interface works works lot more with behavior .
have negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i &apos;ve cho@@ for new social ors .
he looked at me like i just quote a song of whit@@ ney hou@@ ston .
and then we did that , and so , for a while , a competi@@ tive advantage .
con@@ struc@@ tors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an i@@ ter@@ a@@ ative process .
they &apos;re no right to your own facts . &apos; sorry , don &apos;t .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we consu@@ me while we are in the world .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s because of what happened to the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers in 17@@ 7@@ 6 .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ples center ...
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where adverti@@ sing has been ban@@ ned .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you make this crazy call ? &quot;
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy boun@@ de every 8@@ 8 minutes on the surface of the earth .
and you know the body about people who don want to talk about their worst cases ?
con@@ cre@@ te blocks were very quickly the most used building unit in the world .
he makes a stat@@ ement about living now , and maybe also about doing things slowly .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in the vac@@ u@@ um .
there are sign fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where to actually reach .
in israel , they said , if you save a human life , you you save the earth .
so , they don &apos;t pay for food just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
mu@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ run just means the power works to keep the frequ@@ ency .
and then he ad@@ ed , &quot; but our water has no cont@@ amin@@ ants . &quot;
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical diagra@@ m is or@@ dered by age .
that probably f@@ ted very well to the science fi@@ ction role .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and this is a time machine .
it can save the lives of 4@@ , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
if you continue it , the diseases go back , horri@@ ble diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
under@@ pants for exactly a week i did in my su@@ it@@ case .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good in something , you &apos;re probably also also right .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
with that information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficient en@@ cies in the system .
i love this picture because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
are you something that &apos;s a little bit quie@@ t , more reser@@ ve , more conser@@ va@@ tive ?
we then created a team , a great cre@@ w , and we started with this .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wor@@ e a little ison bottle .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
he said , &quot; om@@ a tells all the grand@@ children they &apos;re something special . &quot;
but now the greatest force that will lead us to a world of plus .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te st@@ ones .
you can put a switch in between , and so you &apos;ve created a little sli@@ mmer .
the interesting is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
then , of course , there &apos;s the co2 of this material that lands in the atmosphere .
spa@@ tial thinking is clo@@ sely connected to how we understand most of our environment .
the work of interpre@@ t begins similar of like a theater at@@ theater course .
i said yeah , you need about as long as spo@@ ken language .
and i said , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you don &apos;t like it or not .
people always ask me , what are you actually doing in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of ?
she ta@@ swe@@ et and like taking a bi@@ te from the ocean .
and i fly with a little robo@@ tic stuff through the ge@@ ese of the ship .
i &apos;m just serve it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
if you want to rely on it by 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see building the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
we talk about it ir@@ on@@ ically , with small ads of it say , &quot; progress . &quot;
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never are the same thing .
we never have these feelings when we play games , in games they just don &apos;t exist .
in this time period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different speci@@ alists of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ sti@@ cles in the fe@@ tal tal stage off te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
on the left , you see the visual points , the different cap@@ ded impres@@ sions .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be divi@@ ded into two hal@@ ves .
or even building fra@@ c@@ do@@ of of these cities , or hundreds of distribu@@ ted all over the world ?
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant .
so you have to ti@@ p the i@@ pad and leave the fire@@ flies .
there &apos;s a variety of ways in magic to connect the world and technology together .
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
he kept looking through the window , and he could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ abo@@ h@@ u .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a modi@@ made rock .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it paraly@@ zes instead than free .
we &apos;re about to grow from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little political in@@ cor@@ rect again .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the free profi@@ le is much better .
you might ask : why would anyone actually invest time creating a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
so let me introdu@@ ce you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ rier .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for such attac@@ ks is not in the middle east .
a school uni@@ form up to the butt@@ ons , because it had to go six years .
rec@@ ession . quie@@ still . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and i sent him on .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response , as it &apos;s anti@@ bodies that are attac@@ king human being .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our beginning were we@@ ges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
over time , we focus on the big animals and in the sea are the big fish .
when each of you were born in this room , 6@@ ,000 languages were languages on the earth .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
so , we don &apos;t need cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be climate positive .
and my love to the ocean hol@@ ps with the same inten@@ sity as before and ever .
sorry . if you feel evil , look away , don &apos;t look .
he had an extreme form of in@@ na@@ te side kid@@ ney hyper@@ bubble .
and if you do that , you finally get a cyber@@ wea@@ pon mass destruction .
thank you for for hun@@ ting a fear of heal@@ ing . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
in the summer of 2009 hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered from a inten@@ se ce crisis .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve just got to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
and to my de@@ ement , i hadn &apos;t just written it , but sent sent to the court .
and instead of economic stand@@ still , i see one of the greatest economic sh@@ ots in history .
the family who was afraid of his life took off all the weapons and all the tools .
so he ently he doesn &apos;t like to think , but make it propor@@ tion@@ ately simple .
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six comm@@ ma three kil@@ ogra@@ ms during her life .
and you really have to stay pretty tough about it , but i think it &apos;s going .
no , not because i &apos;m a self ##AT##-##AT## @@ justi@@ fied enjo@@ and a gu@@ inten@@ ar .
so what we need to do at a global level is create a new system .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might es@@ cape some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
we dou@@ from a common ancestors to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
one above all esti@@ ma@@ ted kin@@ dness : somebody actually brought her a few shoes .
so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you can then online online .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
this fact is often put into a context with the increas@@ in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
at this point , i was refer@@ to the the car@@ di@@ ological layer of car@@ di@@ ological service .
do you was@@ h butt@@ ons or ri@@ and@@ sions ? stone or ac@@ id ?
so you don &apos;t have to pay attention classi@@ cal music , because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , my next film , much further .
i think in the ted group there are many who are already enga@@ ged there .
now his new email is , &quot; why isn the research being discus@@ about ? &quot;
nobody wants to change their lives , because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
and so -- this says , &quot; this box is ... &quot; there i write my name .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
she pulled me so much that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the . then she let me go .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need bu@@ re@@ au@@ cy sex@@ y .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ ph@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed this aspe@@ ct in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
secre@@ tly but i actually wanted to go to the real w@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
but in this case , we have to be full gas and get a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians are never achie@@ ving anything .
but when it comes to writing , i think about it recently and i wonder , why ?
so , we pre@@ tend that it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a sou@@ l .
there are technologi@@ concep@@ concep@@ ts , for example , aug@@ mented reality , which is called the aug@@ mented reality .
even though i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested interested in py@@ ro@@ mi@@ ic things .
it &apos;s not possible that everything evol@@ s forever forever and forever as fast as now .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of the co@@ hl@@ tan industry around christ@@ mas was this one .
what &apos;s a story that is break@@ brea@@ s , meaning@@ moments moments moments and end .
in the after@@ noon , people here and there , are phone calls and moving .
so we should percei@@ of it as something that should necessarily be present for our lives .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
yes , kids are naturally naturally curious , or should be curious , designers too .
or c , because you &apos;ve ham@@ ed it to them that they &apos;re in@@ tra@@ si@@ ble .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people from knowledge about it .
you can only , of course , if you &apos;re covered in some way here .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with image points .
a story that inter@@ fron@@ ates with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
we &apos;ve tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it to the mini@@ mal components .
it trans@@ ts co2 into me@@ than@@ e under the use of hydro@@ gen as an energy source .
it &apos;s it in sh@@ ell and ab@@ und@@ ance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy grow .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and lo@@ ving , and workers re@@ main in wa@@ ge and bread .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , something very natural .
well , they were also highly tech , and they were allowed exten@@ sive planning .
it means to produce something that &apos;s in you , ti@@ ck@@ le the potential .
and that &apos;s the nice thing of creating things that are used and interact with the people .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that something going on there .
they tend to make worse decisions -- worse worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
now these decisions diff@@ er in the number of choices that you provide a decision .
but if this happens like this , this changes the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative conditions .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
we can get them to do things that they thought couldn &apos;t .
in an emergen@@ cy layer , i &apos;ve been looking at a blin@@ hing in@@ am@@ ma@@ tion twice .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on a free foot , the location of the aling is un@@ known .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries tried to contact and made a profound mistake .
their own photos are sig@@ ned with meta@@ data that another person has ad@@ ed .
finally , the positive alternative mix@@ es with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
the fourth point is that history for us is a place of information sing .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
it makes certainly sense to be less har@@ m@@ ful about oil consumption .
at every point where you throw away , from , yes , you create opportunities of life again .
but it &apos;s very strange for la@@ y@@ ia , what we musi@@ cians do with our music language .
this woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it wouldn &apos;t see her similar at all .
it &apos;s something in between , and think it changes the way information can be used .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to your imagination can create a reality .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memor@@ ies -- it immediately begins .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- caus@@ ing up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of image points .
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , then i open it .
do you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to restri@@ row it .
for example , here here &apos;s a study that we did in a magazine process .
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 put it up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ using .
and if we have an energy sur@@ plus , then we &apos;ll also have water in over@@ plus .
and so we started with the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
so not more zer@@ os and ones or kr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but just a metaphor .
well , at se@@ vent@@ h , you still have dreams , but not no major memor@@ ies .
but even if you trans@@ late these things , it &apos;s still just a technical thing .
i made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films for a very small audience .
a year ago or so , i read a study that really ble@@ w me right .
i calcul@@ ated that the time it took at 21 billion hours of play time a week .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
what &apos;s interesting today is that re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control systems to appear in our lives .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart of this code .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to be afraid of possibilities that might might sc@@ them .
and what if you want to see van go@@ gh gh this ma@@ ster@@ piece created ?
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th th , it was appro@@ ved for the second time with 1@@ 14 to a voice .
you already have a site site ; and you already mention that area for the second city .
and if your employees can &apos;t hold them apart , your custom@@ ers can &apos;t . &quot;
at mid@@ night , the mon@@ k came and said he had to close the sar@@ g .
we know exactly where all the at@@ m machines are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
you can express your opini@@ on , on every chan@@ nel at any time , and you do it .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
then the next steps , like language and so forth , took less than a million years .
but one of them , with some lu@@ ily may put put two numbers into the right order .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of whatever &apos;s next .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that magic and magic were placed by machines .
green is deli@@ ction , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is input , and orange is cor@@ able .
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all that was a question of choice .
i think that this success pressure has de@@ va@@ st@@ ed our artists over the last 500 years .
in co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious dan@@ ger to our business .
but that brings me back to the point , when are things actually more intui@@ tive ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore want to have ni@@ x to do it too .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ ction , that &apos;s called prop@@ he@@ t .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species of self .
just to give you an sense of cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
and he called that part of his course to x factor , the potential of human will .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very comfortable .
so here we see a young female and a male in a pur@@ su@@ ement game .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been been or@@ ed at the beginning of the talk .
and if we were to show people , then we can make a behavi@@ oral change .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a challen@@ ging as a brand .
one thing , as you know , has been en@@ ligh@@ ed already , there are lots of r@@ ent .
we set up a little cooking pur@@ ket right on the ent@@ r@@ ance of business .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to force ourselves to protect it ...
we choose some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we let them work with urban admini@@ stration .
is that really , then that means we &apos;re here at the moment in the middle of a transition .
the first steps in history i told you took a billion years a piece .
and it &apos;s with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g g re@@ re@@ production . &quot;
we know that an development process is not opti@@ mal when it gets too complicated .
you can go to the website , down@@ load all design pro@@ di@@ tions and make it yourself .
and then all of a sudden you would what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
all you have to say is &quot; educ@@ forms words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
extremely important is , already it extremely extremely important and even much , much important is going to be in the future .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different da@@ y@@ time , in different light .
that leads to star@@ vation death . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to ro@@ rest .
that inclu@@ des everything , the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
instead of breaking your head , just burn it . a great thing .
and it would be the best if you could do it , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
you find crazy examples from all over the world how people optimi@@ ze and re@@ fin@@ ing the system .
i don &apos;t want to the past , and not because i &apos;m an an ad@@ vent@@ ure .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as an experiences .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the living itself ?
now , should i tell you what happened one night when all the sensor@@ s stopped working .
down there , the gra@@ y box is , and on the top , you can see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
so when i travel@@ ed to go to these muse@@ ums , i started a lot of learn .
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you are not . &quot;
this is the work of very smart people at the new urban mechan@@ ics office in boston .
i think we need to do something against a transforma@@ changing piece of medical culture .
and over a period of time from a and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
the second story is to show another concept , the transforma@@ able wa@@ vili@@ range .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never , course never comes .
and now i connect the fil@@ ters with the dru@@ mmer so that i can control the effect live .
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be gri@@ mmer than trees , right ?
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was how to get hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
do we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you that you can solve the technical problem .
now , last year on this site were 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
so i shif@@ ted this and i made this other film about the big ship that goes going .
i asked the top scientists several , &quot; do we need to get down to close zero ?
when countries meet in places like cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
and those of you who &apos;re interested in can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
this is one of the explan@@ ations that are given for the domin@@ ance of memor@@ ing itself .
we set up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king lot te in front of the hospital .
so he would work as well , for example -- in a power station or a car factory .
i think the mo@@ s@@ sad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
and i &apos;ve come to the saying that a new city provi@@ des people new possibilities .
and this problem often often when you look at the long li@@ sts of all this fund .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
and this leads to less happiness with the out@@ comes , even though the results are good .
have you taken a second second or a third on , as you say it beautiful today ?
span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once portra@@ yed a woman .
i had imag@@ ined a kind of journey of the penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better che@@ f than i will ever be .
according with the great possible break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest thing you know ?
but is there a third possibility , a ting , fascinating and terri@@ fying possibility ?
now the first project i want to introdu@@ ce you is actually actually one of the first ones of our lab .
my life is really extremely bl@@ essed by working on some amazing projects .
you can have me as farmer farmer or in lea@@ ther , but no one ever cho@@ ed farmers .
she saved my life by making me use the toi@@ let in the text@@ room .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph and and tag a piece of mr@@ i .
as a young law@@ yer , i had the great privi@@ lege to meet p@@ ink par@@ ks .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
these fe@@ sts were always great , because the dan@@ cers were always professional , and they were fantastic .
these are six thousand countries controll@@ control 40 percent of the oil sp@@ ills .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ amin@@ gos shouldn &apos;t even be there .
and none of these stories are very curious or great -- but one of them is this one .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ bra@@ te at the same time and not to vi@@ bra@@ te ?
and after that , we looked in which case people were buying a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of which the decisions appear in .
it is not about the details of the slide , but &apos;s about the general form .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to re@@ gain your attention .
she said , &quot; first first tell me your mom will always love . &quot;
every second every day , our senses capture much more information than our brain can ever process .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
in a nu@@ ell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer in the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
it already did this a much more friend@@ ly , but of course it &apos;s a much better .
we could only gli@@ de as am@@ or@@ p@@ h m@@ oll@@ through through sea of the world .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the same system when the same price up five percent a year .
there &apos;s usually no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date .
think about a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
it was all all k@@ f@@ a back then , also the je@@ wish was called k@@ f@@ a .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it has no protein , and scientists are building building all this in there .
please watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it &apos;s on the water line .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
she came from school one day , and she &apos;s a teacher , and she was talking about a student .
well , there are all kinds of play@@ solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
he wanted to catch ve the feelings in play . so he built a camera in front of the players .
so what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- a ab@@ led person or a powerful person ?
it has nothing to do to do in particular with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with ancient in@@ i@@ sion .
you can do good as a doctor . as a doctor doctor , but you can do more .
what i have to tell myself all the time if i get crazy about this , is , don &apos;t &apos;t sc@@ afraid .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts , an opini@@ on , or through your audience .
be we know glob@@ glob@@ ally and accu@@ ster and faster and better and better .
as i said , one of the greatest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- made his beginning on youtube .
and again , we &apos;re the story@@ telling as an information medi@@ ing very , very ar@@ re@@ sted .
cer@@ ti@@ fication government cy and make fa@@ ke cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
because he led them to a fe@@ ad on which he doesn &apos;t stop himself at all .
that means we first cho@@ se to find the largest battery in the world .
look at it , this is the today , clean , carbon technology .
serve in a sou@@ p kitchen , clean up a park in the neighborhood .
you have them , you invited them to eat , not for nutri@@ ent the@@ ft .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a quick over@@ view and a symbol of the area it comes from .
this super@@ computer is called global sensi@@ tivity system &quot; of course .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects projects fail .
we want to elimin@@ sh lifetime h@@ ish@@ ings without condi@@ tional trans@@ ment for children .
so then when i looked for a prof@@ ession as an adult , it was the film@@ making .
and it makes me appe@@ excited in terms of der@@ ations that democracy affec@@ ing democracy .
they say that all things that are shown up there follow a life cycle .
so we met in dec@@ ember in the room of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , it &apos;s me me out to planning .
there you usually get out if you call in your city in 3@@ 11 .
when was the last time you heard somebody who talked about mis@@ men@@ ke about failure about fail@@ failure ?
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are quite natural .
the sister , who gave this bra@@ ve act , was brought to an education camp .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to pra@@ it .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ how tom spoke to the free sky , and i tried it .
this au@@ ro@@ est@@ rates around the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase vement of fir@@ ers .
you need biological materials , of biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more in the ground than re@@ new .
in my school time , i went to school with the bus every day , an hour a track .
so there are profound lessons for us about the nature of drive and success .
we &apos;re getting as good at whatever to do as the most most important people in the world .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes you see here are real time control systems .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p called citizens connect .
now , why do we draw graph in technology log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
i think the reason for that is because we realize that there &apos;s something &apos;s going on .
i have a very complicated here , mess@@ or@@ able and conf@@ used idea in my head .
it &apos;s a photograph i only took last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
and what it does is it makes people go into business and ask that question .
a second circle already beginning to cor@@ ate or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
on a lie like this , you see that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundar@@ ies of the potential .
and that &apos;s that b@@ w@@ l students were trained to find a right plan , ok ?
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , that &apos;s ru@@ ined all the experience .
beyond the cities , all of this percei@@ and driving pul@@ ws in into objects of everyday life .
and this is what made made us think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
and then he said three words -- the most un@@ lo@@ fying words i &apos;ve ever heard .
i think the geni@@ re , the style i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
this ch@@ art shows what it looked like when the video first popular last summer .
because i experienced it in 197@@ 1 , la@@ g@@ on in west africa in west africa .
it &apos;s a means with which the sou@@ l of a particular culture fin@@ ds access to the material world .
if i asked you to count the great world religi@@ ons , what would you say ?
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose , people are very difficult for time to even decide .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the sch@@ un@@ ings , there &apos;s no exc@@ for mistakes .
and our approach was to say , okay , actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
and i would invi@@ te everyone to with it and try something out .
you know from bee@@ tho@@ ven that he heard more than he got dea@@ f .
then you use what &apos;s the sun and wind where they live .
we took little robots that we built that wra@@ pped a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
well , we ex@@ run a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
now , this is a direct conflict between the living itself and memory itself .
this will cause the patient to suff@@ , but just a little bit and much less than before .
people are about recogni@@ zing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother bel@@ ly . &quot;
they call this there &quot; stre@@ aming trials &quot; in the united states we call this the tracking .
women , like men , in our bodies have something called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine gl@@ ands .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone does under the ax@@ ess .
two few hur@@ hr@@ in@@ for the school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
and it &apos;s also a good example of government getting crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
the un@@ healthy way i talking about is the one that makes you sick inside .
he got in@@ tra@@ sive anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a , and he re@@ covered a few days later .
i think that can be changed by creating re@@ combin@@ ed vac@@ cin@@ es in wards .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then &apos;s the de@@ vil with it .
in california , a 40 percent percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ now of the si@@ er@@ ra .
and the si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital data .
but su@@ c@@ essi@@ vely moved that writing as a primary medium , got in .
but what i would re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ mi@@ ic things .
well , in efficiency , the bubble , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
in the united states , you &apos;re beginning to measure the experience happiness of the population .
and i turn around , and i see this older man , and i had no idea who he is .
in fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my bas@@ in .
more than anything , everything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
re@@ vi@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sc@@ at@@ al ts , except except was@@ hing day .
just tell me a little bit how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
in 2007 , i decided that we should concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ce@@ o , in the week , is dealing with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
i think the whole picture makes sense if you put it into a few steps of dollars .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
and because that &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human dig@@ ni@@ ty that the law has to respect .
that we &apos;re not fully evol@@ cated as humans as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
and the old saying , &quot; when it ble@@ wers , the demand ris@@ es &quot; is very true .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ . in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
and he knew her , he would have been able to contribu@@ te addi@@ tional information to her .
and i got a bad sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t come from there .
we now have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
the question i want to ask anyone here today : is this idea perfectly fine for you ?
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest mass of ice on the planet .
i ask , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
so the com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ end on us interpre@@ ts to rein@@ rein@@ vent the pieces .
capital , chemistry and machines are on top , and it never produced produced really good for food .
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and think about how we get that to zero .
do we have to introdu@@ de emergen@@ cy ures to try to keep the earth &apos;s temperature stable ?
and that , even though none of them are any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical tical -- it &apos;s just just sugar p@@ ills .
and i &apos;ve discovered some things that make epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies in online worl@@ ds possible .
so scientists recently came up realize that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
but else , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for their lives .
first , a ball game in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ art -- and i don &apos;t think of foot@@ foot@@ ball .
i feel that when we to encoura@@ ge need encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
so what is it an idea to think about building , in hon@@ dur@@ as building a whole new city ?
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy every single wee@@ k@@ day .
i think it &apos;s very hum@@ for us to say that we are the end product of evolution .
a politics of fear and an@@ ger convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
so the am@@ y@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our vehicle dete@@ ctor .
because sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual tive , and technology is a resource liber@@ ating force .
we ad@@ just our standards to the new level , and don &apos;t tell us what was there .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al ##AT##-##AT## @@ da@@ our , and so on and so forth .
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks , and b has those benefits and risks .
and that &apos;s because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less care@@ ful .
you don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad res@@ sing .
they &apos;re never been pleas@@ pleas@@ ously , because their expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are hou@@ se@@ ds .
that means this first impres@@ sion happens in a rapi@@ dly fast speed of how we percei@@ ve things .
and that ev@@ ening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that spar@@ the idea of people here ?
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both su@@ wn together in the idea of happiness .
and the a students get che@@ exam@@ check g@@ ly , get the better teachers and etc .
let &apos;s first look at the reality that today , in some cultures make decisions about their off@@ spring .
for good and evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions will be about us .
and so the film will investi@@ gate this whole idea -- that is what ? in e@@ ni@@ ty , for forever ?
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave the sho@@ ck .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- rather at the early of &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe pro@@ mot@@ ed a lot of development projects .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at that time , man at the same time was media produ@@ cer and medium itself .
it is about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non ##AT##-##AT## @@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about story@@ telling .
every own music is made sted if you &apos;re constantly described from the outside with music .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re hot@@ ter at this place there &apos;s something something true .
and the reality of expression expression es all of us , and moves , inspired and com@@ bine .
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the inter@@ ate step .
this creates a very strong picture in your head , and that &apos;s a lot stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
so many people we have now in the world who spend at least one hour a day online games .
we work with universi@@ ties in all sub ##AT##-##AT## @@ sahar@@ an africa , and invi@@ te them to learn social re@@ design .
that could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; it puts it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
for example , we came to the fact we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
one of the most important things is we need to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory ib@@ m &apos;s super@@ computer wat@@ son at risk ? ?
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want to sna@@ ke , slightly bor@@ row or l@@ p ?
but li@@ the wise , we &apos;re now working on using the same approach@@ es for the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ rene@@ w@@ able , that &apos;s like an au@@ tar@@ ke system .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that really has to be involved into film art . &quot;
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a proje@@ ctor .
and dr. p@@ . always had very color@@ ful flies and was for working with kids just like created .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of percei@@ and pus@@ hing our environment .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that domin@@ ates in the internet culture of tech@@ ies and ge@@ e@@ ks .
and then if you take good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it also pretty reali@@ stic .
all these photos are connected connected , and there creates something something bigger than the sum of the parts .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever .
the real meaning of the word educ@@ ate in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
i even come to one of my favorite ones the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
that &apos;s my intuition didn &apos;t like , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play so often with particles .
she was born in 18@@ 80 , the experience of sla@@ very changed her world very much .
in fact , we thought here was the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process a little further .
when something like happened back then , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
and that &apos;s always a little intui@@ intui@@ tive for us humans if i i have to think very little about it .
it &apos;s become the biggest today , and one of the most important private bird reser@@ ves all over europe .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tas@@ ks under the street light .
and this happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite these experiences .
i worked with people with d@@ war@@ oms -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and listen , everybody has a right right to their mind , even a right to their opini@@ on of progress .
but we know , when we address that , the social relationships are very sensitive ur@@ bed .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become alien to alien to us , and has nothing more nothing to do with reality .
well , unfortunately , we tend more see face face in real life when we face difficult problems .
you have to go up on the fire , and you have to get this woman some shoes . &quot;
steve pin@@ ker has us that we &apos;re currently living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ ers then , and what they might mean for him today .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of power are built on the same base in the world .
climate ma@@ ke@@ p@@ tics do you have one or two sent@@ for them to maybe convince you ?
and the child plays , after a memor@@ break , rather than before a red one now plays a blue flo@@ wer .
within a year , you run a re@@ survey , and then you start with the commercial fis@@ her@@ e .
i myself learned it from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic magic the path fin@@ der in the 197@@ 0s .
man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , reli@@ able fly .
and they &apos;re designed designed by the design that a farmer can just far@@ ate them .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural industrial model for the future .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it &apos;s not .
is this something you can let us share , because you have a few minutes left ?
but at the time when multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular organisms showed up , things started to change .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
we need digital security systems where a human machine oper@@ ator can &apos;t respond fast enough .
and i think our current philosoph@@ y doesn &apos;t help anybody .
mal@@ ig@@ nant car@@ tel@@ les . speak@@ 5 : dangerous cru@@ cru@@ ise ships .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about having chicken to fish ? &quot;
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more .
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed themselves ?
but in the end , it was that i took space scientists with us to the deep sea .
and the basic lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a commit@@ ment sport .
there will be this little blood pressure measu@@ re@@ ment that you &apos;ll close to an iphone or something that .
and they developed special structures , which did nothing else than process@@ ing information within the organis@@ m .
it allows us to produce much complexity than the normal techniques would allow .
over the last three decades , the crimin@@ al rate in america has dec@@ lin@@ ed a men@@ sely .
here , i think , the art and the film may perhaps fill the gap , and simu@@ lations .
but now there &apos;s a old new solution to get us from this mis@@ situation .
you need that lie for a life lie , to susta@@ tain self ##AT##-##AT## @@ de@@ ception .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something in the direction .
don &apos;t wait making a difference in the life of another until you reach@@ ed your first million .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stu@@ pi@@ dest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
now look at happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
are you an up@@ -@@ at@@ te ? are you something that brings your blood into wo@@ ales ?
for example , the most sophisti@@ cated cated version of this kind of communication is the human language .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explo@@ sive cur@@ ve .
i spend most lot of my time with people in investi@@ gation gation , prison or death cells .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and they made a noise noise machine .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
whether it &apos;s an in@@ v@@ ance place of a mind , or a bunch of er@@ ce , is ir@@ relevant .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of ti@@ bet@@ suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at at the bottom level .
and one reason is , this huge heat stor@@ ver is he@@ ating green@@ land from the north .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big foot@@ print that becomes a we@@ t@@ area .
on the day before the event , i called the bo@@ ss of the public work for the company .
instead of pus@@ ging the water , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to re@@ ct the water in .
so three very difficult problems that might be sol@@ vable , and therefore you should work on .
he understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone deal with it was two different things .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ tes fit to everything .
now this may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
the categ@@ ories have to tell something to the vot@@ er , not the one that provi@@ des the choice .
if you know something about government technology , you know it usually doesn &apos;t work .
it was about a method that parents could figure out , which are the right public schools for their children .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard about before will join to global communication .
but before i get to the actual top@@ ic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
we want to get things that have gone or things no longer as they were .
the second largest facili@@ ker we can see today is not motiv@@ ated by money .
i teach wonderful wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i used to .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded each another , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get a little nervous .
so what about the virtu@@ ality that is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is rele@@ ased in the pig@@ s over the soli@@ d ingre@@ di@@ ents of ex@@ cre@@ ment .
they do that because they can follow the stri@@ strated white line on the high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ##AT##-##AT## @@ challenge is , it helps them identify hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to reach to the need@@ le .
so i started thinking about what it is about what we &apos;re going to master these games .
imagine the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , in different resol@@ ution .
if you turn the light on , it looks the same way we saw it before .
it can be , in our case , that we use it to design , and to create a symbol .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d this was so often mentioned today .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is connected to everything .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
and the color sounds and the sha@@ p may may remember you &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
here &apos;s an example . for those of you you who aren not a new yor@@ kers , i &apos;m apo@@ logi@@ ze .
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the ocean as we ste@@ aten fore@@ sts .
and not only that , we used our imagination to do th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly this world .
but these artic@@ were worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
if paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say without ar@@ med wat@@ g@@ gation .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not dam@@ i@@ ans &apos;s special bre@@ e@@ ed meat .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next decade or two , will be part of the national statistics .
you &apos;ve probably heard about &quot; level high , &quot; and &quot; us ##AT##-##AT## @@ one strength , &quot; or &quot; + one intelligence . &quot;
these are our ma@@ ster players . 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in something .
they help in di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
for us and them , play is fundamental to the commit@@ ment of relationships and the care of toler@@ ance .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types to questi@@ the social nor@@ ms .
now you might think that the whole break down of categ@@ ories would someone like me would me really happy .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to make negative energy out of my life .
as we fall down , i had this sense , man , to die is not terri@@ fying .
what would you do that you &apos;re sho@@ ot up because you think you &apos;re there forever ?
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des cab@@ rio .
this is the first object you can see that was in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ twice by con@@ gress .
at the end of one day day , i coo@@ ked a giant po@@ t of sou@@ p that we shared ourselves .
this is because the government is like an ocean , and politics that &apos;s the top 15 in@@ ches .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , the humanity , is , we &apos;ve be@@ gun to abstra@@ ct .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital digital colle@@ ction of photos that you actually recor@@ ded .
we want to fight pre@@ bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ ish@@ justice system .
and this was an example of how our own governments use the technology against us , the citizens .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the that the fish knows something .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice d@@ pole is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system .
a tv set or a was@@ hing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use it .
we just wanted to know , what about a normal pal@@ st@@ normal electro@@ chemical battery ?
that means 15 pounds of wild fish takes to get a po@@ und of power tun@@ a .
one is , the energy den@@ that these technologies create are dra@@ matically lower lower than the power plants .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other companies called es@@ ol@@ ar that has great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
if you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , they &apos;re getting signific@@ antly better .
i believe that you &apos;re moved to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wonder thinking .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated stuff like , example , mani@@ ok .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people equ@@ ally , life is not made of teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
our cities have been equi@@ in the last few years , just equi@@ pped with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
when these ima@@ points fall down , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
no , they didn &apos;t destro@@ y the building ; it &apos;s just like the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
so for example , number 16@@ 4 is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a back@@ ground conversation .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less more .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order to change where this information is pres@@ ented .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pit@@ ch of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance dance in every culture .
this was our first attemp@@ t to start with the digital information , with the genome , ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
and i just want to go to proto@@ co@@ l , that i was here for my part of the jobs today . &quot;
an example from a very different area . mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ ero@@ sen times .
and now what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper , you can find in this third sentence .
and the prepar@@ ations for this were enormous . we had to build c@@ ameras and head@@ head@@ lights and all kinds of things .
we &apos;ve come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and sou@@ table to ourselves who can afford it .
i really hope that we play great games together to survive another century on this planet .
or are we wired to become something else -- something that may even adap@@ ted better to the environment ?
and as part of it , they gave us a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ground .
just to give you the over@@ view , i zo@@ om out so you can see what you get .
one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
and the next puzz@@ le piece is about four women in three generations who are building a new life together .
you might think that this is just a landscape picture , and the bottom part has mani@@ pul@@ ated .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight we all fight for who can talk ; they can all talk .
well , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think this &apos;s the way this is going to happen .
you have to make the sound of the wind , b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
and sometimes , when something comes across ted , it gets a meaning and a power that it otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
because obviously an animal that was been very lot , becomes r@@ ar@@ rare before it dies .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , as this slide should show .
it actually took a few years starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
in china china , a head of the night today is still hon@@ hon@@ ey po@@ ver today , to a sense , right ?
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven vent@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ half percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ up players .
players love to become part of a@@ we mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary ex@@ ures .
and the argument here here would be the whe@@ els of evolution slowly slowly , but they &apos;re rel@@ hau@@ less .
i was the second volunte@@ er at the burn , so i had pretty good opportunities to go there .
and the side kid@@ ne@@ ones make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
how can we longer keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
i seemed to me that like our fan@@ cy clo@@ ches and c@@ ameras kept us dre@@ dre@@ aming .
in both cases , i &apos;t send them home , and there were probably no man@@ gers in their treatment .
by sha@@ king the the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to other , he can the characters interact .
you just can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough how critical this factor can be for the quality of life of life .
either &quot; fl@@ n fusion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; you &apos;ll have a choice .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model in the world as long you &apos;re not a partic@@ le physi@@ ist .
the next puzz@@ le piece is how a boat in early morning red quie@@ t on la@@ ke .
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of sti@@ ves , st@@ ones , ki@@ ot@@ les and sh@@ ells .
it &apos;s to these arch@@ a@@ ic models that we have a basically natural ra@@ ti@@ o to virtu@@ ality .
and in reality , when we fail when we hit ob@@ stac@@ les we often feel different .
for her , life had given her a : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in australia .
already today in some flat kes flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e comes out of the water .
so , in the way of shif@@ ting bur@@ den , you see the brilli@@ ence of the lie .
and this is what you see animals right next to a degrees cel@@ grade that they can survive there .
so we can understand each other , i &apos;d want to show you a fundamental very simple magic trick .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son : myster@@ y science theater was a first to make a jo@@ ke on twitter .
also , despite its log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic course on the left left , it goes up@@ ward .
on the day day they read them go -- prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they &apos;re strong sub@@ bo@@ tions , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
so probably or evil a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fishing building , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
it sounds very spac@@ ical , and it sounds sounds very sci@@ en@@ ce ##AT##-##AT## @@ fi@@ ction , i know .
fam@@ fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . speak@@ er three : o@@ .@@ c. spra@@ y the police .
it kind of managed to find the time to look at english and it@@ it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
his mother was lo@@ cked , as a pun@@ ish@@ ment for -- for the crime to be weal@@ thy .
now re@@ productive all the rest ining ones that have best the numbers best .
that i just just this this differently and make it beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better hand@@ able .
we need to prevent people from knowledge from things , especially then when they &apos;re true .
but it &apos;s not , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physi@@ cally the european european .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america america &apos;s most gel@@ es@@ ly children &apos;s auth@@ or .
here it &apos;s necessary to bring what we understand under tically cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness bring over and over again .
in this country , for children children , there are lives for children without condi@@ tional trans@@ lation .
this is almost limited to security -- possibly for fish , definitely definitely for us .
and that &apos;s half of all the wa@@ ge problems in the world are caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
now , when i was a ne@@ ul@@ ing at college , i had my first bi@@ biology cour@@ ses .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
here &apos;s some really cool stuff that we discovered -- really w me out of the so@@ cks .
the the idea this is obviously not just to listen at the machine machine oper@@ ders in the control room .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
so we could very run the world very easily with do@@ wers , maybe even hundreds of thousands of new cities .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ le@@ ged , of e@@ ase , of legi@@ ti@@ mate cla@@ ction .
but let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
we have almost an infin@@ ite choice of phones now , especially in the world of mobile phones .
maybe go back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between human beings and the myster@@ y of creative .
i brought you an example from the north north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka@@ ka indi@@ be .
so we know from that study that you have to reach to the need@@ le when it go to the thing .
we know that as human beings work opti@@ mal when we do hard , important work .
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that will allow you to walk faster and longer ?
so maybe we we sell a sho@@ e , and he &apos;s going to the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever car@@ ried ...
and i think the most important point about this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
make ways that are easy to use , and start with this to hu@@ g patients in the team .
we say , &quot; computers , please generate a hundred million rand@@ om@@ cho@@ sen sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
this question was so profound that we decided to explore the answer and and developed si@@ ft@@ ables .
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by ti@@ pping the p@@ ace in one direction or another .
and so in interest in it , because of this technology , i &apos;ve just going to go go on into there .
all of this needs the ability , our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with bes@@ i@@ des actual existence as a designer .
this is called design law law or just design psychology , which also affec@@ affec@@ ts us in perception .
a third sentence that comes immediately in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
and maybe we just know what wood wood we cut of if we &apos;re really che@@ sted .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to get rid of it .
so basically , i &apos;m about , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand brand person@@ ality what would it be ?
so there are all tools tools , and the only thing that im@@ mi@@ ates us is our imagination .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government was mostly about choo@@ cking people into a office .
so when we see the news , we pre@@ fer looking for negative news .
i &apos;m going to rel@@ to a stati@@ stic that i hope that most of you have heard before .
in high school , a fellow student said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a blood test .
unfortunately , not in open b@@ ach , but maybe you can help frank@@ fur@@ ars a little bit .
we &apos;ve , for example , an ice scre@@ am pac@@ ka@@ , which is liquid at room temperature , &apos;s flu@@ id .
well , so you see , in all cases , nobody has to be a obvious can@@ di@@ date .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in species species and the des@@ stry of humans .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and and look at at this there , just because you can see what kind the problems you get .
i assu@@ sure me they don &apos;t bi@@ te . in fact they probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some down@@ sides .
this is sort of de@@ ad@@ line , which has shown us the environmental models that we need to con@@ tain .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clou@@ ds that move things around ?
our memory tells us stories , which means what we have to keep from our experiences is a story .
you don &apos;t sit around and you fli@@ around . there &apos;s always quite ge@@ ed something important to do .
and so by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years since since his i have to say , very successful introdu@@ ction .
and that sa@@ dness really formed in one thought , which is that i wish shed one thing .
so for me , the photograph@@ y seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i could have ever written by hand .
police off@@ ic@@ als came in and x@@ y state law@@ yers and office workers .
this refer@@ er will suggest to invest the money in more security forces and security .
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country didn &apos;t really occu@@ place the class of violent cri@@ mes .
when i went back there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ k to half of its size .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve &apos;ve mis@@ sed this point on choice impro@@ han@@ ces our public good .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased from the cells and came back back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
that &apos;s great . the ro@@ bes didn &apos;t really think that a a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water water out of this mel@@ ting water .
it &apos;s important for designers , they usually have in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the the great design laws .
i remem@@ ber@@ ed last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es , and somehow , people liked that .
you can see that it &apos;s a of a colum@@ n , often called the &quot; sen@@ ing wave re@@ actor . &quot;
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics , who made me crazy crazy weren &apos;t fan@@ a@@ tics at at all .
nothing moves into my sle@@ ve or comes out , not tri@@ ck@@ y , and you can study everything .
but in fact , my my research at the institute of the future , there &apos;s exactly opposite opposite opposite .
this is also the entertain@@ value of this talk , so i hope you &apos;ve enjo@@ yed fun .
you can change the cells in your body , what if you could change the cells of your driving ?
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better , that &apos;s more successful , who &apos;s more friend@@ ly ?
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be poor@@ ly zed if you wear bright red pants .
now , mor@@ gan , be@@ half of transpar@@ ency this : what happened to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
and was also done a study with ce@@ os where they watched the ce@@ os for a week .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exten@@ mented reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that maybe our species has exi@@ sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
and this really puts these ideas that create these limit@@ ations to what space available on the screen .
we &apos;ve managed to pay it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put these little pieces together and cor@@ rect the mistakes .
so for the learning process of music , music language takes at least as long as spo@@ ken language .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later when we moved to california .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifest@@ yle .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
so we have the memor@@ ing self and the survi@@ vor@@ s itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot;
that means we have a common ance@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
i got another gift , which is into the future and come back and live differently .
so we list our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t really accept it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i or@@ ore my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go in and do this crazy case .
if i go to a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
if you break the gold fish glass , so everything is possible , you &apos;ll dro@@ k happiness .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
this is a game with words , which is kind of a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
because often often people come , they can &apos;t make it user friend@@ ly so anyone can deal with it .
sounds first it sounds very ban@@ al , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re a at closer to it .
super@@ view : now i &apos;m kind of inter@@ acting with the object , can can zo@@ om out , zo@@ om in in .
so here see this again , we see again the dies@@ el , again here , the whole , single ag@@ gre@@ gate .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor guy , which seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
people wra@@ p in their belie@@ fs , so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t them free .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 images of it , i would have spent an more hour .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- until my physi@@ o@@ therapy .
evolution is all about the pas@@ ation of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ tation and survival , generation after generation .
all right , just to close , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
if you surro@@ with the right people , not only will you understand , you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate it .
so doing these things -- you know , re@@ people of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
they make the decision -- push push them even when it comes to their own best interest .
so in other words , the future has s@@ hr@@ k a year every year since i been in this world .
and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing an evolutionary process in the machine , which is happening in the micro@@ -@@ second area .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch it &apos;s being taken over to the next century .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ v@@ ine minds of creativity , &quot; demon@@ s . &quot;
this is a very basic service . is there have light at home so you can read the home@@ work ?
in the rich world , there are diseases that have thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us before just one generation , har@@ dly yet .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children are going to die of it , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
because if we could figure that out , we we sort of have un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human potential .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and you &apos;re said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go oil . &quot;
it feels what i want to do where i want to go then then increase my strength and per@@ si@@ ance .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them through few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ des ?
who knows , when the movie comes out then , we might look like a hor@@ de hor@@ de vol@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , i &apos;m &apos;t going to tell you about where the wir@@ eless plan works .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them spon@@ tane@@ ously ously , but it &apos;s going to happen , and what &apos;s happening happening right now .
i &apos;m sure i would never able to reach an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , and it seemed to be pretty un@@ likely to me .
that would have been without the environmental dem@@ demand , but it still makes it much more important .
vac@@ cin@@ , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions billions of people , are success@@ es of the scientific method .
they played a cu@@ be ce game , and the vic@@ ors were allowed to break up to an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , in my view were the original an@@ atom@@ ic activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
and in order to win , the device has to make a better diagno@@ sis than a team highly quali@@ fied physi@@ cians .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion were produced -- or 75 blocks for every person on the planet .
the man &apos;s grand@@ father was not afraid before the arc@@ tic night or or the weather stor@@ m .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t po@@ p ##AT##-##AT## @@ u@@ ps , and other non@@ sense anymore -- it should not be necessary .
he doesn &apos;t have any piece of paper he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe recor@@ ds .
as peter told us they produce not just the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ ze happiness of the two kinds of self , you end up up up doing very different things .
i &apos;m going to start with demon@@ stration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , trial and mistakes , which turns out to be meaning@@ less .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a , or we could do b .
immediately , you &apos;ll experience one for of course , there are such predi@@ tions for and you can &apos;t prove that .
the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
my heart ra@@ ced , i was di@@ zz@@ y me while i was trying to touch what was in front of me .
but back and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the per@@ tors actually actually over@@ global .
in open@@ b@@ ach for example , at the hou@@ tr@@ arb@@ age age , 20 percent of the waste of of land@@ ash is now di@@ zz@@ ers .
but here here &apos;s it : if you get evidence , you have to accept this evidence , and that &apos;s not good at that .
so now i &apos;m before one of my favorite images , harv@@ est workers of pie@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel in the met .
the first example is what many of you know and some of you know , very few don &apos;t need at all .
so there just get these kinds words that we &apos;re also use in the language of poli@@ tically cor@@ rect speech over and over again .
so these were ten@@ red to survive longer , and they multi@@ pli@@ ed in greater ex@@ tent .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , they bring us back these possibilities back to re@@ discover our skills .
his cause of writing the piece becomes more and more of my personal cause of playing it .
but there &apos;s no clu@@ bs we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
and the main lesson that i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
i want to explain to you today with this mechan@@ ism today , or get something that you &apos;re probably un@@ consci@@ ously familiar with .
i talked talking to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were announ@@ cing this model .
that &apos;s as if i said , sh@@ ke your child , beat it three times rather than five times .
in the moment , it was as if a film director had dem@@ and@@ a a ir@@ on shift .
it turns out that it actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t &apos;t have anything to do with their movie . &quot;
and we think we will be the first fuel fuel the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
and it &apos;s about solving , in a play@@ ful , creative , original way , solving a problem .
the machine machine age happened , and what &apos;s the book , and what &apos;s the oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
when profess@@ ors are getting curious , they &apos;re often s@@ wal@@ hed up in the research se@@ me@@ ster .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has has to do with them dec@@ ei@@ ing yourself .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ um that helps you on jum@@ low .
so , we were able to connect the little digital spr@@ in@@ head with the ro@@ tor@@ control .
so the neurons are the information process@@ process@@ ing system that these cell@@ ular communities built .
it &apos;s obvious that it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated to cop@@ e with bacteria .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time time in several places , what would that feel like ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws last year boston to fly the code for america program .
one method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used a lot l@@ ately , is evolution itself .
there are as contro@@ versi@@ al things like these gene@@ tically changing plants in the cro@@ es .
so that as citizens , you &apos;re able to deal with these scientific technologies .
because the ground takes the mo@@ s@@ ses die off , and the wind and the water was@@ hes away the ground .
they lie , they che@@ at , they &apos;re conf@@ used and produce really dr@@ ought shapes .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
it &apos;s about how satis@@ fied or happy the person is when that person thinks about their life .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a non ##AT##-##AT## @@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
so the idea is that we actually engage people where they do things together , collective .
well , an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment is usually usually something that you find because you &apos;ve dro@@ pped it somewhere .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we &apos;ve actually ed what the goal is .
you can go out and create your own museum online -- from all these images you can put your own colle@@ ction .
the result is that i no matter where i come , i treated like i &apos;m pro@@ ted to the dec@@ line .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that really have to go into cir@@ cy@@ cles .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take there a piece of far of the future ?
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at the wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall .
if anyone had built a two ##AT##-##AT## @@ in@@ ch construction , he would have contribu@@ ried the price home .
they &apos;ve re@@ formed the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of earth in a way that no war has ever done .
three billion hours a week are not not nearly nearly enough to solve the world most ur@@ gent problems in the world .
but not only that -- they use and conne@@ connect themselves with the universe and other devices out there .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time of my life trying to be myself myself and to ada@@ pt at the same time .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down into 20 parts , as you know it from docum@@ ent@@ ent@@ ations .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and yet , my interest in y started when i received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
and when you take an picture with a camera , the process ends when you press ee@@ impact on tri@@ g@@ ger .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins when the tri@@ g@@ ger is expres@@ sed .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the chemicals that are found in it have spread to un@@ equal quanti@@ ties .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian but also very ti@@ temporary .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educ@@ productive members of the human community bring us ?
for these non ##AT##-##AT## @@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics has just become another material .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re taken by your mind . how can you damage ad@@ you ?
so people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a point have mis@@ sed a lot of biology .
there &apos;s an old african ada@@ ge : &quot; if you want to be fast , go on yourself .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , you understand this easier , because in h@@ oll@@ and the country is on flo@@ wers .
this is really important because this is a reali@@ ght that is not in a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ure .
if we can do that , this data tra@@ p , becomes a new source of meaning@@ ful information .
and there &apos;s certainly ambi@@ gu@@ ity about how bad they &apos;re going to , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically go , you get about six that have stable structures .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , or conser@@ vation , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
maybe that &apos;s the sense of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , an perception of the em@@ pi@@ dom , a sense of our own power .
if a mind has ds of these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and a new forms of existence .
and you will offer them all the nutri@@ ents that you could want , without effort on any effort .
and it seemed to pre@@ fer , with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control systems .
i tried to make clear how valuable cities are , how much valuable they are than they cost .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
they live in a world that has information and communication in ab@@ plus , as nobody could ever have predi@@ cted .
if you found an article with wrong thought well , you could dete@@ ct the cre@@ ator of that thought .
we made little pieces , we made a er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tly , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is still a little explan@@ ation of you &apos;re about to see .
so when i come , i play with my little v w and i imagine myself , that feeling comes up .
that was the reason . it was the legal fication . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and i noticed how much these deep@@ -@@ sea ving ge@@ kes , were like a space mission like .
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there are a chance in a million .
and even even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it ur@@ ges people to work together very quickly .
so &apos;s how to work with prototyp@@ es is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vac@@ cin@@ ation for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little article .
i know we can do , and as far as i know , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
but dan@@ ny , throughout american desire , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
our language indi@@ c@@ es the social changes that in many cases were dis@@ caused by technologi@@ cal change .
so in this project , we actually designed some little mark@@ ers to track the tr@@ ash as it goes through the system .
ic@@ e@@ mountains are born as a cal@@ f of a gl@@ aci@@ er , or by breaking out of of ice she@@ ars .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
now , since the film had pre@@ mi@@ at the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ festi@@ val , we can just look at this .
this is one of the images that we held with what &apos;s called called gi@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
and so they wrote all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
the more opportunities they gave them , the more likely they put all of their money in p@@ ure market accoun@@ ts .
today we want to talk about how videos are becoming vi@@ ral , and then finally , why that is important at all .
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , which is our genes , is of exactly the same code and the same ty@@ pe@@ writer .
here and today in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of the male black population have perman@@ antly lost their ele@@ ction .
never make a mistake , but nobody thinks about the details of how this is done .
i enjoy that , but but i &apos;m best to learn best best to pass it to others .
now language is not just just the whole of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ matic creatures .
you can only be taken in associated to some other chemicals that den@@ at@@ u@@ late the ma@@ o .
his un@@ cle went to her hol@@ iness to the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life can exist in space and move , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly exactly what their genetic code will look like .
he lives in the deep sea , about a and a half miles deep at nearly coo@@ cooking water temper@@ atures .
so if you want to have better , you have to cross and hold your percentage of the deal .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you a ti@@ -@@ lap@@ se se that has happened in the last 25 years .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series sequence that i &apos;m doing with a simple equ@@ ation program .
and so it &apos;s also so ro@@ ro@@ ot@@ ed in us that we can deal with with the virtu@@ ality so well .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the theme of which is behind , of course , is us@@ ability .
there &apos;s an extra a contra@@ ct on , cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le ver@@ ct , where anyone can come with me .
in the present at for something , we have a very modern example that kee@@ over over the da@@ y@@ new@@ spa@@ pers .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , actually more important than anyone else on the planet .
and we don &apos;t like our kids a fa@@ if we give them the feel that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the vic@@ age team and the prime minister at the same time .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
then , one day , he came back from walking and he said , &quot; dad , my legs cr@@ b@@ ble . &quot;
i have to talk to the man on the street who are like me , ot@@ to normal user .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o the link to the ted@@ talk .
of the people who sta@@ yed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mel@@ ade .
and the first thing i ask employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities different from each other .
we had a team working on a project last year last boston , took three people two and a half months .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry industry had a do@@ zen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that they contribu@@ te through thro@@ wing away to the bio@@ diversity .
sure , i &apos;m going to cut out out some paint ts as well , but get new new for that .
you have to communicate , of course , the battery , and you have to be able to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
but not just any mission mission , but a mission that f@@ f@@ its perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
his work is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
spee@@ ds are not an ob@@ stac@@ le we need to cur@@ ve to get better with our lives .
and i hear a guy saying behind me , &quot; well if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
but the challenge is to try and out what it are and why we keep them , and whether they makes sense .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al er@@ ror , and that was the following .
please help us do this and try to improve health just improve a little bit , but to it in your hand .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available every ow@@ ner of a mobile phone .
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on was around pal@@ ms and by a few man@@ gro@@ ves .
for example , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from tru@@ w in u@@ kra@@ ine .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
if you want to know how sea level is ris@@ ing through land ice mel@@ at , there &apos;s it flo@@ pping into the sea .
maybe you can stand up for a moment , so at the break you can talk to the two about the project .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
now , i don &apos;t like this question , because it determin@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system over the last 50 years .
the only problem with this was i lived in a small village in canada , 3,000 miles away from the next ocean .
it actually si@@ so soli@@ ghtly in its place that i can sha@@ ke it without the kni@@ fe falls down .
and also &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ story of why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worl@@ ds in real life .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who car@@ carrying all this can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
some of you may have heard that i turned on an ad on e@@ bay few weeks ago .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted one piece of puzz@@ le to next , and the ed@@ ges ges didn &apos;t fit together .
that all of a sudden that the appe@@ is becoming becoming increasingly more important to success , just the us@@ ability is becoming an app@@ lic@@ ation .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click it away now .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om one of my favorite parts of this picture , until i &apos;m really in the cra@@ cks .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is what this new world will be like ?
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this will@@ ness , but not in our country .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a of time time here except to say that we &apos;re going to contribu@@ te to this area .
and then we started , we went to the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and we explor@@ ed it with robot tics .
you know , in the next 50 years , we need to grow 70 percent more food than right now , 70 percent .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are , you won &apos;t get the rect answer .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel sent the t@@ we@@ et , who ended made the video so popular the day .
we &apos;re so far that only for the pleasure purpose , we can write something thing in this code .
and it showed that today human pattern recogni@@ tion is better fol@@ ding proteins proteins than the best super@@ computers .
now , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ina .
and the last game , we bring out on mar@@ ch 3 , and it &apos;s a game in combin@@ collaboration with the world bank .
so you have to think you another philosop@@ hi@@ cal top@@ , a perman@@ ent burn from the philosoph@@ y , present .
in particular , i ck ck the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ m , &quot; &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
so do that , i &apos;m going to talk first some some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
if we wanted to travel anywhere at the time , we would jum@@ ped into a car and we s@@ wir@@ wing across the sky .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . just do . i don &apos;t want be@@ er . &quot;
each of you , everybody -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and also the wind doesn &apos;t wake all the time .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses how we should understand the future .
this is a spec@@ tac@@ ular image of the at@@ las in the construction , so you can see the scale of scale .
even better , he was grown in a@@ qu@@ ak@@ ul@@ ture after the sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know boundar@@ ies , as posed to own , distin@@ ary human imagination .
she opened a computer business , then did a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic , and then opened a business .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it were some brilliant brilliant there , and we made the break@@ through .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this s@@ ack there is a bag bag and will to talk instead .
i decided that the rele@@ ase of light fire@@ flies would be this year a year contribu@@ tion to the environment here .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fossil fu@@ els , burning either coal or natural gas .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort numbers , that &apos;s a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it already .
how about the arab spring and spring and the things that happened for example in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
i have to just get a little bit about this , and bio@@ ha@@ cking is dealing with modern molecular biology .
can i use that directly , or do i need the n man@@ ual , or do i &apos;t need a promis@@ ing de@@ to do it .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like i was in a science fi@@ ction movie .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally present within the shi@@ w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were treated as something special and pre@@ cious .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es out of second hand on fle@@ markets and in secon@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ hand sh@@ ops .
then we put the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , on the tr@@ ash , and started tracking it .
in a pris@@ cep@@ ception , only my sister and i , then then you self and my grandmother would have dr@@ of it .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have any ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded in .
and so you can then acceler@@ ate the particles strong enough , and then they also go into the oni@@ on .
he gets phone calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
his flexi@@ ble design allows to ho@@ ft deep , to cra@@ w@@ l and make highly agi@@ le mov@@ ements .
the most important po@@ post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the pri@@ ani@@ in@@ cen@@ tive facili@@ ty in nat@@ ance .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ min@@ ut , hall@@ mark , to discover this kind of brand@@ brand .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you &apos;re pi@@ cky at choice .
and even though i gradu@@ gradu@@ ated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
but when we com@@ bine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look kind of wrong .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that con@@ cts three ##AT##-##AT## @@ ten@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old children to death in ja@@ il .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
so western governments provide tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments , so they can go against their own citizens .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;re spa@@ tial cally related to each other .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all come for -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors go into the room , sit on this chair , put this hel@@ met .
once i &apos;ve seen this , that there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er in there , you know that .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined they &apos;re to be the first country in the world that ga@@ cts phosp@@ hor@@ back .
unfortunately , i was much too young so he was emer@@ ged when i finally started studying .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and he &apos;s part , &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le k@@ is@@ s . &quot;
we made docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but actually science , more specifically , space science .
these are very good things , and poverty redu@@ means to make these services almost everyone on the planet .
and that team team that gover@@ es and pay attention to work will improve the performance of the team signific@@ antly improve .
and some of you may have read the new book by mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; over@@ fly . &quot;
this is just one example of many of how adults can den@@ power posi@@ tions tions a imagination of a child .
we &apos;re so far to imagine this device with our industrial partner this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on in this year .
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
are they establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ?
she remin@@ ded me that i was now as old as she was then when we clim@@ bed the boat .
i once did the new@@ spa@@ pers and looked for the best head@@ lines i could find .
they &apos;re no longer taught kids anymore . which means if there &apos;s nothing done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
so , na@@ gen@@ babies are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental , nor are they cho@@ sen by the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy you don &apos;t help .
if you really want to exist , come back to a che@@ west moment if i can take care of you .
because you can see that i &apos;m invest@@ ing everything i have , and i don &apos;t have more than that .
here are ones that have been stri@@ strated in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve basically seen now in the last two years is that the scientists are put themselves on my side .
and as i was playing , i noticed noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ &apos;s eyes , a complete change was going on .
and my head became we@@ we@@ ak about this coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had on the ev@@ ening .
until this this day , i feel deep@@ est a@@ we for what i see on my di@@ di@@ ves .
our inten@@ tion was to in and look at the inside of the shi@@ pping , which had never been done before .
maybe too much time when you think about how many problems we des@@ per@@ to solve in the real world .
and the only problem is you think you can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not real real .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and leave them in .
the first time i was in the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice mountains mountains .
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;m photograph@@ ging is very young -- a few years years old .
they choose to choose for things that make less satis@@ themselves , even if they make it obje@@ obje@@ tively better .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car maker who gives you the opportunity to completely re@@ con@@ fig@@ your car car .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become vic@@ ti@@ ms of a pen@@ ish@@ ty , not less .
so we think that this is a situation where software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me that i really &apos;t identi@@ identify .
but this doesn &apos;t expres@@ ress the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
now we think our love of stories depen@@ ds on we as a child on the la@@ p of our parents .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means that the water rema@@ ins longer in the me@@ a@@ dow .
he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke and how someone po@@ ison him in the sleep .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ el man@@ ic an@@ ger turned into understanding , into a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and hu@@ mili@@ ty .
the idea became really tan@@ ble to them , you know , that there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
then they invest a little bit time in planning and organization , and they sk@@ et@@ ch and they out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put him reas@@ on@@ able , the way we can do today .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 ent@@ its is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
they live in the dep@@ ths of con@@ gol@@ ese wh@@ forest , and they &apos;re hard to ble to obser@@ vation .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person as actually male , but they &apos;re &apos;t really that .
i mean , i hope that with this digital medium , we &apos;re be talking to art , and we publi@@ proper@@ ly repres@@ proper@@ ly online .
the program is called &quot; code for america , and it &apos;s kind of like the peace sc@@ or@@ ps for computer fre@@ a@@ ks .
and certainly , we we have have saved these these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and a lot of people do that .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i get still cho@@ sen .
and the vo@@ o@@ do@@ ists like to say , &quot; your white one goes to the church and talk about god .
you probably think that the pos@@ er wrote exactly everything in the notes that he came up of .
our organis@@ m invented a great method to just get un@@ comfortable emotions like ti@@ to disappe@@ ar .
now when i look here , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this copy and the spor@@ ts species .
it could have every single image could have a impul@@ se that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of people or something like that .
it takes the same -- it needs love , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s us to give these things .
about a month after that , i ited an es@@ say of my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not lots of arti@@ stic talent .
there are billions of people in the developing world who not even have a single city that would wel@@ come them .
who could have predi@@ &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
in one , i was the classi@@ asi@@ an student who asked un@@ ent@@ less dem@@ ands about themselves .
a few days later , we went to budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around their sar@@ g .
they &apos;re terri@@ terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in it , they re@@ pair them .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that came the next to my talks .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single mu@@ ble .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use time .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the feet of the se@@ man@@ tic information that many of these images have .
now i &apos;ve argue that this is not gen@@ es@@ is -- this is based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years evolution .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity completely came from their own individual .
this de@@ des and stor@@ ps all e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ achie@@ vable expec@@ tations of success .
because they ju@@ ju@@ red an assu@@ mption forward you can see something that you recognize , pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented circle .
that means , at the moment , you have to make sure that the rene@@ w@@ ables can , , a sense , take the entire web .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys , &quot; sustainable energy to the hot air . &quot;
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
the rul@@ ers of the old world had no concept concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the birth right .
while i was thinking about it later , i occur@@ red to me , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
if i had actually been an e@@ go ist , i would have written it on a virus and rele@@ ased into the room .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes planes pick up , one falls off .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business so so far , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be it soon .
and these other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive properties , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do less less attra@@ ctive .
you may know this too , if you &apos;re a little interested in this , of the austr@@ ali@@ an na@@ tive ants .
in the the last 20 years , fif@@ te@@ tens a thousand tons of ur@@ an distribu@@ spread on our fields in germany .
you could just throw throw in a li@@ ter of al@@ po@@ ly , and then the facili@@ ty would be ru@@ ined over years .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future good food , it will be deli@@ cious .
we need market input , control co2 , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a price signal .
figure out how they would survive . most of our players have main@@ ed the game e ##AT##-##AT## @@ game hab@@ its .
i think just like them , we sometimes play alone , and we read the limit@@ ations of our inner ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
you can see here he starts roll@@ ing , and the boat moved to the other side , the man stands there .
but usually i have an ac@@ cess@@ ire , like sun@@ glas@@ ses or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such stuff .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ ts of every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could represent your brain .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel imagine new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us things they first don &apos;t believe .
this mental ori@@ entation is the core of what i think the ted communities communities to engage it too .
in the mean@@ time , in the same year at the bell lab@@ s was announ@@ ced the next revolution , the next building block .
an interesting thing about this kind of appli@@ cations , is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions .
that &apos;s why all western rich have always exp@@ and@@ ing until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;ve been im@@ plo@@ ded .
this is not not scienti@@ fically cor@@ cor@@ rect , because we don &apos;t know how much is k@@ is@@ ed away it .
don &apos;t , in@@ san@@ ity , children &apos;s play stuff , we calcul@@ calcul@@ ated everything , never calcu@@ late .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they could read if they google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct .
so for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as &apos;s cham@@ bers in an old bu@@ ell book .
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ stic example of this , a study of invest@@ ments in volunte@@ er care .
so no longer saving , reduce , avoid , reduce , not scho@@ il@@ bt management , but smart waste .
and that &apos;s because in the middle area , people are the most active here , and they &apos;re the fra@@ gi@@ est over here .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community an obvious wish , and you heard to help you and do something .
although al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass it doesn &apos;t come like p@@ ure metal .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the most fundamental questions of life .
but in ancient ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
we want to imagine the best possible out@@ come , and then em@@ power people to get this idea into reality .
in last fall , it had to sign in@@ sol@@ ven@@ z , because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar been ha@@ cked .
and then more or@@ cated effects like p@@ ace and volu@@ volu@@ me that you &apos;re apply on the entire sequence .
so what we have here are the cover of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ strated that have ever been prin@@ ted .
in math education , i was always caught by the teacher , as i was painting ding , hidden in the text@@ book .
all over the city , no police cy cy el for five years , no po@@ poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
in so@@ cially we@@ ak and black parts of the population , des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness because of these changes .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s soldiers got sil@@ ver ta@@ cks , na@@ po@@ le@@ le@@ on himself got gold bri@@ ta@@ on .
that the human should come from the mon@@ keys , and , yes , at least there would a ance@@ ance@@ or between humans and mon@@ keys .
to realize that these categ@@ ories are much un@@ cure than we thought makes me excited .
i had very low expec@@ tations . i had no con@@ cre@@ te expec@@ tations when they were only in one way .
you can afford that , because if you cool them down very far , they become become so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called super@@ conduc@@ conduc@@ tors .
now i &apos;m now older than ch@@ op@@ in at two years old when he wrote the piece .
and then she ran , she ran to her husband and said , &quot; that &apos;s probably not true what charles was writing about .
the reason i hold holding my wr@@ ist is because there &apos;s the actual secret of illusion is .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve ad@@ to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
i know they were ra@@ c@@ zed , i know they were sex@@ xi@@ ist , but they were great .
so we start to rely on computers for a process that is a different different from classi@@ c engineering engineering .
now i know it , and now i pro@@ the forward forward that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and if you place that exactly in the middle between two equal ha@@ ha@@ port , it &apos;ll star@@ ish .
they bre@@ ed in a city 40 kilometers away , where the soil nature is better for the ma@@ inten@@ ance .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish finish their epi@@ c mission .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present present , sometimes it &apos;s har@@ dly to see , but it &apos;s with me all the time .
my brother said , &quot; well , on . today we do it , you &apos;ll do do anything we do .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think right , i started working on a contra@@ ct .
i want to start by asking you to think of the time of your childhood when you were playing with building blocks .
that is , everything that coun@@ ts life is it &apos;s not about saving , to avoid , to reduce .
but we should just be familiar with this fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a beautiful beautiful somewhere else .
d@@ k : you know , i think there &apos;s recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness research in politics .
we find men in the mar@@ an@@ ing ro@@ ws of citi@@ zen rights movement , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
well , well , i want to susta@@ susta@@ certain separ@@ ations , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
it could be , for example , say , a us@@ american power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask ask you to think about it because things change .
it sort s and flo@@ through all the information in looking for any any indi@@ cation cation of risk in our environment .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many bi@@ ologists have tried to understand and that at different levels .
and you feed it by just holding a clay si@@ p@@ able to a sequen@@ cing pen@@ able .
and here , here he sees a pattern of b@@ und@@ les that remin@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
to me young young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me a ad@@ vice how to do this . &quot;
a com@@ military of mine wrote to me a couple of weeks ago , and said she thinks i &apos;m a little too sh@@ ri@@ mp .
this was the first strategy experiment in real time the world of war@@ cra@@ ft series . this was 16 years ago .
the point is the computing of a super@@ computer is that people only have 23 years left on the planet .
if you think you &apos;re inside and there are a wonderful person , then there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps make up a ma@@ c computer made of how they came together .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the big digital spr@@ in@@ head -- we got a gli@@ mp@@ se by looking at very carefully at data and data structures .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , on a assem@@ bly line in a car factory , six days , double la@@ yers .
so if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i say that because identity means power .
in fact , i knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ra@@ al tu@@ bu@@ stor@@ re a@@ zi@@ do@@ sis .
i or@@ dered flu@@ i@@ des to re@@ hy@@ dri@@ ate him , and i asked my colleagues to look at it as well .
and he did , and when he set a contra@@ den@@ ement in the right sector , he called the oper@@ ators .
we have a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect course of disease for a patient with ch@@ est pain .
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a mov@@ tion@@ tion@@ controlled con@@ fe@@ ti@@ i can@@ n@@ on .
if we ask these coun@@ t@@ ous world cultures for the meaning of being human , they respon@@ respond with 10,000 different voices .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce with the real world .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ gical pack , in fact that &apos;s made for going back into the cycle .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians politicians they occu@@ tour it in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ of our facili@@ ty .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have there on this island .
they built this complicated series of chan@@ n@@ els , and they pus@@ hed water out of the country and into the river .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually taste good .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical separ@@ ations that make sense to me , and that i think we should keep .
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman in any state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states today .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a smo@@ oth forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
it &apos;s basically going out to the bu@@ ri@@ ic nuclear power plant , and on the ani@@ um in@@ cen@@ tive plant in nat@@ ha .
there was a meeting for re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of your way . &quot;
al@@ umin@@ um at that time was most pre@@ cious metal on the planet , more valuable gold gold and pla@@ te .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge dou@@ bled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
what about the people who are &apos;t possible this because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the west , for example ?
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a whole mas cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate from ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or it was it .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a question of choice .
if you want to cut far , coo@@ k@@ ie , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on he said .
when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s cre@@ ep@@ y -- that &apos;s just how my creative process is going on . &quot;
it was ill@@ umin@@ ted by the inside and ill@@ t from the bottom , and everything ble@@ w himself through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
and i &apos;ve brought this project as an example , add@@ res@@ ressed to these arch@@ a@@ ical , cognitive models .
what &apos;s wonderful is , if i stand with a du@@ o partner on the stage , and we have the same wave l@@ ength .
and it &apos;s important to me to keep back into the notes , even if i mean to memor@@ ize them .
that is that to make music on the instrument , your own musical musical doing and feeling should already been present before .
and then this un@@ comfortable feeling disappe@@ ars , and it couldn &apos;t see you similar to all , and you &apos;re getting more more and similar .
because music allows him to re@@ form his thoughts and ma@@ sions with help his imagination and creativity into something real .
it turns out mi@@ gu@@ el spent most of his career in mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , i could connect my pre@@ ference for under@@ under@@ world and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and i went .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary dea@@ ths in a country that is pla@@ ed worse than any other person by this disease .
so i looked at games like the world of war@@ craft , which gives the ide@@ al environment for collective problem m ##AT##-##AT## @@ solving .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we want to take people vi@@ tal organs and want to plant them to other people .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year ##AT##-##AT## @@ ol@@ ds should the right to give their way of understanding of sex or mar@@ ry .
so that if we try to make a more more more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years plac@@ ing in situations that are usually very difficult and at at the same time kind of dangerous .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive side .
and he poin@@ ted the the char@@ ges of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day and usually had their c@@ ameras ameras of it .
we have three perfectly imag@@ vable physical objects that we can all identify with in a three ##AT##-##AT## @@ dimensional world .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ ami si@@ work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
and do we trust , we blind trust every future government , a government that we may have have in 50 years ?
now we &apos;re trying to ask , can we re@@ generate life , or can we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be mis@@ -@@ free .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i ta@@ stes because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america is the super@@ star . &quot;
the stories of gut refle@@ were different , and because a very critical part of the story how it ends .
now , because the thinking itself is responsible yourself , you can end up -- some people could end up going to california .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get increasingly un@@ happy , the poor@@ ger they get .
or are we going to sel@@ ec@@ tively different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us and not for some of us ?
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she &apos;s playing ac@@ ac@@ efully with water .
and for example , if you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of dence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; it took quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
a child in london shows the picture of a fu@@ ve and says , &quot; oh , today i saw a fo@@ ve . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you you will always take care of her . &quot;
every generation looks of the images images you take at the beginning of your conscious life as a standard , and will der@@ i@@ ct all of it .
if you &apos;re sus@@ pe@@ cted in a crime case , you &apos;s kind of ely ta@@ pping into your tele@@ phone .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of be an remark@@ ingly in@@ t@@ ous species .
when we first sequen@@ the genome in 199@@ 5 , the er@@ ror rate was a mistake per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
he just looked into the sky , and he said , &quot; sorry , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving car ? &quot;
and the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which appe@@ ared over some under@@ water is@@ lands , is particularly strong in mel@@ ting .
then , after about 30 seconds , you mix@@ ed again , and you &apos;ve got try a new letter combin@@ ation and new possibilities .
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ area , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot of lot .
we need to lead dialo@@ gue more rational and more fully , and also the things that are taken by the government .
so what happens when you put mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that the memory provi@@ des us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we inv@@ ent .
i mean , do you , when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ for your self ##AT##-##AT## @@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
now you can imagine how amazing it is then when children are born , who are two people in a body .
as the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it rele@@ ases miner@@ al@@ it@@ c drin@@ king water water fe@@ e@@ ds many forms of life .
and you can also see it here , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers and je@@ t@@ blue .
i was under the star@@ ry sky in the desert along with su@@ f@@ i sing@@ ers , mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
that we need to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , of entertain@@ ment and creativity creativity with humanity , p@@ ity and justice .
this story &apos;ve heard this story many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos lands or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
let &apos;s look at &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks into categ@@ ories .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y could be re@@ formed over songs .
in fact , you burn the waste waste , and you can even use the waste of today re@@ tors as pro@@ pul@@ sion .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if everything well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could keep it easily .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what &apos;s happening to people who go to california , hop@@ ing to get happ@@ ier .
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about resol@@ solving stere@@ liche about gender , so in fe@@ min@@ ism , nothing is female .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
i think , clo@@ clo@@ sing , to me , the main thing that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
and because of this help , i was cho@@ sen in my year of ju@@ ra@@ school , as a young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; appe@@ ars soon , and turns about statistics , and to use them to set up a great baseball team .
today are three people on this planet for everyone who exists in 194@@ 6 , within 40 years , it will be four .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters in the wid@@ th , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
but i want to say that , of course , , it &apos;s a promis@@ appropriate impro@@ vement for us to also make certain things .
i made my di@@ ve in a pool of the y@@ m@@ ca in the winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
not long after that , a doctor went into my hospital , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think , we just need to simpli@@ fy it .
half of the custom@@ ers will go from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 car colors to the low possibilities , four ge@@ ves .
and it was my mission , when the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f looked for car@@ di@@ ological ological ad@@ vice , to look at the emergen@@ cy patient .
so i took my view from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i talked my comm@@ ment towards empty empty corner of the room .
the energy hunger in the world that is wi@@ ped with dies@@ el , because you don &apos;t need any per@@ mission .
the dies@@ el is back@@ -up , and wind , sun sun uses the bur@@ den so that they can map the larger propor@@ tion .
but if you want to ga@@ together several of these inter@@ actions , and they &apos;re supposed to build a net , that will be very complicated .
but i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to the w@@ re@@ ck . we film the real w@@ re@@ ck .
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but the same time it feels like science makes its own .
and as a free computer , they start re@@ acting in other way , they &apos;re percei@@ ved and driven driven .
there would be a way to live in a city that was in hon@@ dur@@ as instead of hundreds of kilometers away in the north .
we don &apos;t think the thing in pictures images things no longer in images , but we co@@ di@@ them to our language .
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as a law , and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like the non ##AT##-##AT## @@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
you think into that time , like looking at con@@ temporary images or reading liter@@ ature .
practice that , for example , if you &apos;ll meet a human being you can then tell you , there &apos;s no predi@@ ction .
and just as the bio@@ sphere was highly ried moved , this happened with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- only at even greater speed .
that means , if you &apos;re 7@@ ty percent rene@@ w@@ able , you won &apos;t be to do it without memory .
so you can see that looking at information and data in this way remin@@ minds of swi@@ mming in a living information graph .
coming from these two experiences , a whole new world was achie@@ ed , a whole new world of creativity for film creation .
you &apos;re looking y , even during study , with the subject of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
but only those who who still still in school -- bes@@ i@@ des the students who had mis@@ sed the school .
but this is an essen@@ ally important compon@@ ent , if you want to make things accor@@ d@@ ingly , to be intui@@ tive .
and here you see me when i was trying the test of the sensor@@ s that opened the water , not get we@@ t .
they offer 50 investment fund fund -- 10 percent less staf@@ f participa@@ te than if they were only offer offer five . why ?
a plan to bring back to work , make us sa@@ fer and to help us stop global warming .
there are questions and problems with the people we were always right . so be skep@@ tical .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a lau@@ ghter that sha@@ kes the trees .
woman 2 : mostly hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part part broo@@ kl@@ y@@ n girl -- i don &apos;t know .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine nine minutes categ@@ ory to those in in in one hour of categ@@ ory ?
and it was my job was to stay a@@ wake wake every night until their ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake wake them up .
this is why the dom@@ e of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent was made from al@@ umin@@ um .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but you &apos;re yourself bad .
in a b@@ -@@ ded continent , these people were the only ones who were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the spa@@ in .
now you need to know that the in@@ u@@ it are no afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
and you can put those sounds in into the sequence that you can organi@@ ran@@ again into any patterns .
another project project made of the french group in paris , which worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
he &apos;s just interested in liber@@ ing himself itself before the need to have to prove that there are predi@@ ction .
but in art and in ing , failure has to be an alternative , because there guar@@ guar@@ an@@ es a trust wor@@ board .
almost every manufacturing manufacturing tion today em@@ it@@ ting co2 today , except the rene@@ w@@ able energy and nuclear energy .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and give a talk on the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary .
there are more people left if it was 24 , about 60 percent than if it was six , about 40 percent .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , as many people think it should be .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m teaching teaching my students afri@@ can@@ -@@ american history , and i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very .
the gli@@ der tra@@ of their sle@@ ges were origin@@ ally made out of fish that was wra@@ pped in bu@@ a skin in car@@ ib@@ an skin .
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fish me@@ irs , and then he said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes a brain stri@@ beat , or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and while i worked for google , i tried to bring together this desire -- to make art acc@@ essi@@ ble -- with technology .
the ones who really want to make a choice are off@@ ered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
but combin@@ ed in a certain way , you can create something that still looks three dimensional as if it could exist .
and yeah , i even car@@ ed the house at top of the island red to make it look swe@@ swe@@ dis@@ h .
now there &apos;s a large community of people who make the tools that we need to actually pac@@ things things together .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil and i started here at ted here a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
the ro@@ ms had the same idea , called this kind of body bo@@ less creative mind a a geni@@ us .
sure , there there some some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when if i just can just sing ?
and i don &apos;t want to make the impact or the heavy of of fighting of a human .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional traditional kind , of course , im@@ im@@ ted by the forces of nature .
all over the world , there are 700 million people who cla@@ mit that they &apos;d like to live perman@@ ently in a different place .
again of that , only a tiny percentage ever gets vi@@ ral , and it &apos;s thousands thousands of times , and so to the cultural moment .
being here at ted , seeing seeing and listening , how stimul@@ ating that is , gave me a lot of power .
if we don &apos;t deal it with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
and the ne@@ at thing about this is that the crimin@@ al rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as is going back by over 9@@ 50 percent .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play something i did un@@ en to the c@@ elli@@ sts .
there was a long break in the gui@@ dance , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too too much chicken in the world . &quot;
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of crisis ine@@ quali@@ ties in the distribution , not over@@ total production .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that occur@@ to me a few months months ago at writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ?
next year , when it finished in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in one to four months .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and disc@@ uss with them .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out much more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology allowed .
i &apos;ll come back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ka@@ ged for this exciting week here at ted .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ bes , and we can &apos;t quite make out what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
i &apos;m talking about terror@@ ism , time time the end of re@@ construction , until the beginning of the world ii world ii .
but then finally , these reali@@ ties are f@@ loo@@ pped by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ plac@@ ation , boundar@@ y .
the reason is changed . for -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral , mat@@ sch@@ is cra@@ p .
so all you need to do is to connect a blue one and a green one together , and you can build very quickly build larger cir@@ cles .
i have to say frank@@ ly , you got it with me , and i didn to mind at a time to talk about my idea .
that &apos;s in a small style , so you can also use your z@@ in the car over a little mu@@ ju@@ er .

so , he says , it &apos;s completely logi@@ cal right now that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
will we going a society a society of di@@ -@@ bor@@ er and uni@@ for@@ mal , or ro@@ bu@@ ster and multi@@ diver@@ se ?
so we go out and we play with it and see how it respon@@ ds , and then we start developing our intuition there .
and chicago has just introduced it , so that people will sp@@ ase the bu@@ er@@ sti@@ up when it &apos;s ti@@ ws .
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is that you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;

there are several known cases of online milli@@ on@@ aries , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ aries that have ear@@ ved their money through attac@@ ks .
the suffering &apos;s suffering can can be in@@ toler@@ able , but the people &apos;s spirit mind is something un@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more greater good you have .
we can put 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o plants from the components being off@@ ered in this one business .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit changed the way i worked , and it &apos;s res@@ cu@@ ed me before .
so anyone who &apos;s gam@@ ed a sou@@ p he left for too long has done it .
i &apos;m playing the piece today every a few years , and it &apos;s always trans@@ ted for me , even though not a single note has changed .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the sing@@ ing because the parents haven &apos;t pre@@ it , won &apos;t do it by themselves .

a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , which is yellow at one end and red at the other , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dra@@ matically increase that time .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global re@@ cool@@ ation that took almost 20 years , which could explain the fam@@ ine .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
and if it &apos;s win@@ dy , if you want to reduce sy@@ ring@@ inge , you can even leave the roof down .
now if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certain@@ confidence .
today i want to talk about one of the greatest decision problems of our modern time , the decisi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ making problem .
it became a golden access to a world of pi@@ ates and un@@ fortun@@ ate ships and images in my imagination .
she sat me down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i watched you . &quot;
in fact , the media pre@@ fer it to show us negative top@@ ics , because our minds pay attention to these top@@ issues .
there &apos;s now cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the u.s. era , who &apos;s trying to make bio@@ fuel , gas@@ ol@@ ine from al@@ ga@@ e .
i think the stream would have been ll@@ ed if he had the sound possibilities of today &apos;s modern ve today .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do you fly 40 kilometers to the farm and do you fly back 40 kilometers back the night ?
our cor@@ n@@ cham@@ ber is thre@@ danger@@ today , not because of dec@@ lin@@ ding supply , but because of dec@@ gra@@ ding resources .
nobody had ever explor@@ ed inside of w@@ re@@ ck . you had no means for this . so we developed the technology necessary .
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the living itself over time .
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , the u.k. , a case study was done , and at the time gy@@ m@@ asia asia into over@@ all schools .
i realized then by connected the dots together that life is about being a great father .
you see , if you ad@@ in transpar@@ ency in the google search , that &apos;s -- this is one of the first images that appe@@ ars .
it works very simple : every time i jump to the scale , it send my data also to google health .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling telling that can connect re@@ a@@ ders around the world .
and the nur@@ se thought about it , and said said in more way , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
we now have technologies because of these quick syn@@ thes@@ techniques to do what we call combin@@ at@@ atory gene@@ tics .
they put more information about the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any subject in any other wi@@ ki in the world .
of course , this leads to some major major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries .
and i want to think about the ways that democracy might look like , or have looked like if we had the mothers more involved .
but then , once we have all the visual points , you can play with it play with color motion gravity and revol@@ ving movement .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that they had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
i met people in all habit@@ ats , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limit@@ ders of the possible .
and so , every book and every world becomes a little mu@@ ble that i dra@@ g here to the magic device in the device .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never dr@@ w@@ ned a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
i gave her medicine we call di@@ u@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water tab@@ ills , so that they left the liquid id .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ to plus billion str@@ ms of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million fi@@ bers a day .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er said just before his died , in his last interview , &quot; each of my books killed me a little bit further . &quot;
she wi@@ ped the po@@ em on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body , and she took it on the piece of paper .
these are energy poor , you talk about many square kilometers , a thousand times more area than an normal power station .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have + one speech and + one crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
the other half of the custom@@ go from the low possibilities , four businesses to the 5@@ 6 car colors , many possibilities .
this slide shows data from analysis from us about the performance of ris@@ c process@@ ors to the performance of a local area networks .
not change and technology thre@@ at@@ the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . the ug@@ ly face of domin@@ ance .
so the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers went to the cities and the cities kept had to go further away get their nutri@@ ents .
the truth is that nobody in all medicine medicine knows what a good surge@@ on or doctor or res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant .
after a four@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old and film stri@@ sa@@ ga , a boat sli@@ pped still on the la@@ ke , cam@@ ned as a fis@@ fishing boat .
and how do we rel@@ ate it it without losing our minds , but to keeping ourselves on the opposite , in intellectual health ?
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest@@ es in do@@ zens of companies doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i try to support this .
i don &apos;t mean ma@@ gi@@ cians and kit@@ es , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
my home state , al@@ ab@@ ama , constantly dra@@ ls the right to vote when they &apos;re con@@ vi@@ cted crimin@@ ally .
two days later , i came to my emergen@@ cy service , and my bo@@ om@@ mate asked me to a conversation to her office .
either it becomes a classi@@ c cur@@ ve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create completely different , something that makes people think think that challen@@ ges our world view .
we found 30 mistakes at the res@@ ra@@ ance , and if we had used the original sequence , it would never been possible to go up .
but i &apos;m going to go back in a moment and i &apos;ll show you by trial that you also have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
and they &apos;ve been passed more more and more over over the cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can look and achieve re@@ deal with its people .
this is a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ re ##AT##-##AT## @@ control that goes down down to form an smo@@ oth v before .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad maps , but they used the gene co@@ ted son@@ gl@@ ines , or trau@@ g@@ ils .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we haven &apos;t tried , and what you can &apos;t sam@@ ple that .
now let &apos;s take look at the wheel@@ chair driver , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
he then built built this hel@@ met out there , and he walked in the co@@ operation with the museum .
we have not just in art , in fol@@ k tex@@ ting , but also in science such such great lies .
and so the image result that we &apos;re better generally general general is obje@@ ctive , and we feel worse .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of gut refle@@ ction than patient b .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consi@@ up of two parts -- a sen@@ ctive part and a re@@ acting ar@@ row .
and i took the time that i wa@@ sted for meaning@@ less things with people who mean something .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ -- like like this strange bear that still brea@@ sts .
we love wee@@ &apos; markets . we love little family businesses . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat bi@@ o .
and what came out was the first computer@@ gener@@ ated software sur@@ fing figure that was ever to see in a movie .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man pres@@ ented a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born to the birthday m@@ in , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch of ch , 19@@ 80 .
for years years because i &apos;ve interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of gender difference .
so after what we first looked for was syste@@ systems func@@ tional calls , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and this is a very good news because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
we re@@ make the past that people can &apos;t understand because standard standards have changed and are very low .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to reduce depen@@ dence on old , dir@@ ty ty fu@@ els that in@@ her@@ ate our world .
you go in the spirit through this house in which you live in , and you look at how many do@@ ors are there .
and that &apos;s designed ge@@ ted for i discover the outside world , so that i re@@ re@@ explore the real world .
and what does that , of course , intui@@ tive , and how does our chan@@ n@@ n@@ els of perception work , and how does the cognitive process@@ ing work ?
you &apos;ve bru@@ t@@ ally done civilization over five and thousand years , because you &apos;ve always able to bring the nutri@@ ents back .
that &apos;s not not about making the standing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
the artist shares them something about , and especially this lady , which she don &apos;t see when she just looks look in the mirror .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not our wor@@ thy , and we really need to to hold this up .
so we have these perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that in many ways are proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able .
i told him , &quot; well did you consider political as@@ y@@ l instead of an operation to separate them ? &quot;
and we went to school distri@@ distri@@ cts where companies are their their way in hu@@ pover@@ ished schools , all over america .
imagine half of the people who want in a@@ part@@ ments did this , but half of half yet .
but one important point he does is , whenever you decide for one thing , you decide not to do other things .
the artist of the age was prote@@ cted from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ is@@ s@@ m , right ?
so if i invi@@ te you to food and say that &apos;s free of chicken , it doesn &apos;t help you anything .
and for that purpose , , people will always come and and look at our experim@@ level that we sort of of our in@@ island level .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i would only know about my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
and then he goes and falls into more talking of rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and strange water plants .
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t s@@ for fis@@ her@@ skin at all .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ te , and we re@@ duced it to a small sum@@ mary .
and yet you kind of get the impres@@ sion that you should count what &apos;s going on during that moments of life , our lives is .
we te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been jo@@ with them over the last three years .
but most importantly , it is that between the perception of our in@@ ade@@ and our great inv@@ ent@@ spirit , there is a connection .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing really well , and i think we would do our thing good in the future .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be something female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking beyond his life support system .
there was a energy there , in@@ rel@@ per@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of the hu@@ mili@@ ty and the of ge .
now after two years , i came to the conclu@@ sion that communities are all about about th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a shor@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ ted view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
in one of the connections , between over a thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a man@@ ic fe@@ ct .
we need this lie at this point that kee@@ us us de@@ ception without which we can &apos;t even live on .
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed feed their fish . a farm that meas@@ ures success on their predat@@ ors &apos; success .
but to see it in the context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ ancestors started to right .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m car@@ ries a x chromo@@ some hits the x chromo@@ some of the protein cell .
now they did this , because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ atory system where two things grew in together .
or un@@ regul@@ arly , but three dimensions , where what changes is is the light , not the position of points .
and after experim@@ experim@@ enting with different kinds of che@@ ese , i occur@@ red that this is a tar@@ ge@@ ted attack .
we &apos;re going to be equi@@ pped both men and for women -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z sent this video that he fil@@ med before his house in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
my third little story talks about my collabor@@ ity in ad@@ introdu@@ pping the s@@ ling fis@@ her@@ ies in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
that means every day , if you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
now , the engineers of you are going to look at you and say , &quot; no you don &apos;t do that . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at the university in al@@ as@@ ka has travel@@ ed with another work group to another flat flat la@@ as last winter .
here you have this mechan@@ ism with which we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our conditions of life .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
that &apos;s what we have that easy in real real life , this sense that in a finger@@ cu@@ p , there &apos;s kind of staf@@ f .
simple , you go into it -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s the power of the zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om in .
and the more we &apos;re sel@@ ec@@ ec@@ ting , the better we &apos;ll be able to make the art of the decision .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two little girls .
i was sho@@ sho@@ in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died , 1,000 kilometers away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and these two pictures ful@@ fill these two dem@@ ands -- sho@@ shot from the same al@@ hei@@ ght and the same ill@@ um@@ ination species .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you can see that the future is still in the year 2000 .
other medical profession@@ are also afraid of it , but the emergen@@ cy medicine is very special because we only only see the patients so vol@@ ti@@ ely .
i personally don &apos;t accept that that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change this .
and what she found was per 10 investment fund that the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , took the participa@@ ction by two percent .
now we can go again the second sentence , and can say , if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , he has no freedom of will .
if you close the game , you get from the world bank get the a@@ ward &quot; social break@@ or@@ ation , &quot; degree in 2010 .
we put our asse@@ mates out to the hou@@ ow@@ hol@@ ship , where , surpris@@ ingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
not every day will offer us an chance to save the lives of a human , but every day off@@ ers us the opportunity to change one .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like swi@@ mming pool sha@@ ped hole and this thing .
and the fe@@ ands of broken english english were tra@@ pped between people who had one thing in common : they started re@@ start .
i think of it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take and com@@ ble different pieces to create an alternative reality .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian indian e@@ po@@ s &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires much more of us than we didn &apos;t care care about it .
during the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er came it trou@@ ur@@ that that the jan@@ it@@ or was in the court room .
and i learned in my little roof in the si@@ western res@@ iden@@ z at tor@@ onto general hospital , far from here .
i went to it , and we made re@@ su@@ tions throughout the southern south chinese sea , and especially in ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
in that head , knowledge was called , and with these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge has just been passed on .
over time , you get get cla@@ ands , and you want to have a little more more ices ices there there or even taste sub@@ tle differences .
that seemed the best way to uni@@ te my inner ge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
development has has stopped in a time ago a time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concep@@ ts are around .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method , which &apos;s a different approach .
ok , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single out@@ come . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , games , more cu@@ box games , invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ di@@ en invented during a fam@@ ine .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- everything was impossible at some point .
so this communication now allowed the reasons of communities , which were , in a sense , in the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tic .
there are a lot places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you whose problem is not too big choice .
and maybe anyone will never call god &apos;s name when they turns , but what should they do with the rest of his life ?
the so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which comes out of the body here .
so a very , exciting process of how certain things go off and what parts second second of these things happen .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing important than to stabili@@ ze the human population .
i was 24 years old and pol@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ form when a mon@@ str@@ ous p@@ ot tree paraly@@ zed me during a sk@@ et@@ ride .

also , we brought seven progra@@ mm@@ ers around the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners the world -- to us home .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , they come and start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
here in california california , for example , in the next five years , you spend a billion dollars for death pen@@ al@@ ty one billion dollars .
and if you look for google with your smar@@ t@@ phone , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton 15 years ago .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , which one that we all think is right , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
this is what happens when you try to get inter@@ rup@@ ted sources over let &apos;s say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
but despite all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that make , in a sense it almost impossible to think clearly about happiness .
i got a great education part -- i &apos;m &apos;t worried -- but i had too many muse@@ ums and these works of no access .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we to the mov@@ ements of our grandmother in the house .
the other thing we want to ask for is that companies around over world are helping us in con@@ fir@@ m these a@@ e@@ ds .
and this is many many ways a symbol of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and all the citizens in the world .
the more possibilities there are , the more it it nothing nothing to gre@@ all , that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting for the choice they make .
and if you fil@@ ter@@ ocean oceans cheap and and simply , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet planet &apos;s lifetime .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
now the average age of our field is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
the other view is not , did somebody deser@@ ve death for a crime , but : did we deser@@ ve to kill ?
finally , please read this carto@@ on , and , a highly sophisti@@ cated person , says , &quot; ah what does this fish know ?
not if i think of lo@@ cally col@@ o@@ gical , and the neighb@@ or thinks less e@@ col@@ o@@ gical , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
and so i can let a evolution run over millions of years on the computer within a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
so much more natural , which in a ves@@ sel , but i kind of see directly , where is s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in there .
that &apos;s what each of you do all the time , but he does it un@@ conscious and and sort of intui@@ tive , or par@@ tly instin@@ ctive .
so , they sent half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 game hours a week .
at the end of , he sent us an email with this content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve recor@@ ded something .
we had the vo@@ ul@@ ing age , we &apos;ve had the machine machine age , and we &apos;re now bing what &apos;s called cyber@@ -@@ age .
arch@@ a@@ a@@ an cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve qui@@ red in the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial times .
i have such a of cognitive feedback co@@ ction , you &apos;ve j@@ vis@@ ated what you want to see .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes ors , i as@@ pi@@ red to get better in everything i pac@@ ka@@ ged .
so i &apos;m going to stick this need@@ le into my skin and drive through through you until you stick it on the other side .
in any way that we don &apos;t &apos;t quite understand , these dro@@ p@@ ks have learned the ability to write down information .
maybe we can &apos;t tri@@ g@@ te the thought of 500 years of rational ism ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
for example , you &apos;ll come to worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to over@@ come this success ?
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the orig@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps , and deter@@ mine what kind of this bel@@ ed to .
and the wir@@ es are he@@ ating slightly , and and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ pe@@ ans suddenly en@@ counter electrical resi@@ stance .
and we also noticed that they were very profession@@ ally constru@@ cted by people who obviously had the insi@@ der information .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean the clo@@ g@@ ged gul@@ l@@ ys .
and the cat@@ ast@@ hi@@ ers around the world have contribu@@ ted in a really extraordinary tent and never pre@@ pre@@ d@@ ented ex@@ tent .
but it &apos;s really always about finding such a attra@@ ct access , having a play@@ ful out@@ deal with it .
this is just a little taste of the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s gave us into our past and present .
typically , our system is on the idea that a certain an@@ atom@@ ical jump comes with a particular identity .
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , which is in a particular chemical form of which we call dna .
nobody in the world of the marketing knows this , because if they were to , they didn &apos;t know what this is all about .
that was quite intui@@ tive , so everybody just put their wi@@ sh@@ es , their and what moves them stop , then .
it has to be co@@ her@@ ent me this here and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how come come your fish taste so good ? &quot;
we know that happiness means main@@ ly to be satis@@ with with people we like , to spend time with time with people we like .
so one of the intui@@ tions you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can only only in a place .
this thing has it has the ability to be in the quant@@ um mechan@@ super@@ position , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch is the new air@@ port port , which was built in den@@ ver .
and we in the west we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would restri@@ mit the freedom of speech .
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants wei@@ about four times more than we humans .
one day the head of the company called and asked if could i i do at a event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
and if you do it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked that they &apos;re actually be capable of something like this . that &apos;s an an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
so i immediately called up the 2009 input , and i expected me to find a contribu@@ tion here .
and you can go approach him , and it will open up to jump through through , as you can see in this picture .
income distribution will make sure that everybody &apos;s doing better -- not just the poor -- because all this big sele@@ ction pla@@ es us .

when we started our research at stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , was completely un@@ known , what was the sense and the purpose of this construction .

it &apos;s because you &apos;re bus@@ with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i mar@@ ry now ?

in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day into the oceans .

i &apos;ll get the whole over@@ view , can now filter on this , and i can say , just show me the thing cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
you might say that it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bar@@ ash or car@@ vor@@ ves .

they put us able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one rock after another .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor will tell you what to do .
they really go it through and they create a frame where this can be discus@@ wide wide , because we need support from all sides .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully everything goes well , the kni@@ fe is held by my na@@ physical magne@@ tis@@ m .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i organized for mom@@ a later in the year , during the summer .

i resi@@ stant to a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when m@@ s. prin@@ ter was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the the hospital .
they put their hands together , and they started sing@@ , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
and the commercial device costs about five te@@ a thousand euro@@ s up@@ ward or something like that , ju@@ hn@@ onal don@@ ds by the fif@@ 50 .
and when i tell somebody , give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , on the right to think about where it is in there .
i &apos;m talking now about imple@@ putting this whole environmental discussion , space , 40 years of clu@@ b@@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ ro@@ me , in quality .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including all of you to spend more time with playing bigger bigger and great games .
so i talked about you@@ gen@@ dar@@ gen@@ ness and education , and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and un@@ g@@ le@@ ated .
so after this incredibly conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go to this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ itely difficult .
then it goes to the past , and so i can very elegan@@ tly over@@ bridge waiting , for example , the the computer if i know this phenomenon .
and of course , it brea@@ ks your heart to hear that in fact , the one ##AT##-##AT## @@ were told , they were only enough .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british col@@ om@@ bia , and i believed that these fore@@ sts are there to be dec@@ lin@@ ed .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , which moves with other earlier , completely syn@@ chr@@ ony .
and what we found was that the more fund were off@@ ered that , in fact , the rate rate was lower .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it &apos;s that we &apos;re dealing dealing with something that &apos;s actually self ##AT##-##AT## @@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ ble , but &apos;s not that that .
these are the kind of thought that can get someone start drink g@@ in in the morning , and and i don &apos;t want to .
so what we &apos;re looking is a little bit of metal is it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a spr@@ p@@ board board , and it &apos;s standing over the ed@@ ges over .
and i have a lec@@ ture the top of the other picture in cop@@ cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on theme .
we &apos;ve all heard about fat and n@@ y@@ h@@ s , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
in other things of life , which are much more significant than buying buying of objects , hits the same explosion of choice .
people who have never gotten , have never felt immediately immediately with your body what it &apos;s like to make a sound .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard heard when people say nobody has the inten@@ tion to build a wall .
as chimpanze@@ es are led by great , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing guys , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ society is led by em@@ power@@ powered fe@@ males .
imagine a pi@@ p , cl@@ p .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good good , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an un@@ conven@@ able assu@@ mption for human .
it was a beautiful fish , ta@@ sted , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , content , a best selling eller on the men@@ u .
secon@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the influence of my garden e@@ acy on the environment and also to my pur@@ wal@@ exchange .

and to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ e@@ ve or comes out of him , i &apos;m just going to put my wr@@ ist together right here .
and during that gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve left this gather@@ ing just the way it was always , only only we ad@@ a little thing thing .
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , that gives us a pretty good picture of how they did it .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came from combin@@ ations of programs that have come a little closer to pres@@ ture than others .
and it &apos;s just just mal sele@@ ction . we can sel@@ ec@@ ct life , the production of chemicals or fuel production v@@ acc@@ ine production and so on .
that means for a child who has spent until the achie@@ ing of grand@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old spent spent of most of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
so you had to also learn , so no little dd@@ child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it su@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and and propor@@ tion@@ of course .
because while they &apos;re bus@@ y with reali@@ that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predi@@ predi@@ ction , the man is quite happy .

you &apos;ve also seen a little example of evolution where he showed a little evolution in the con@@ vol@@ ution program program right in front of your eyes .

it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ im@@ ie , but we can , by shif@@ ting software dna , we can change things quite dra@@ matically .
so you have to deal with this , what that means , and not just change it just that it &apos;s different , but it should also get better .
these notes are about as accu@@ rate or un@@ accu@@ as a verb@@ al , even very seem@@ ingly pen@@ i@@ bel pre@@ cise , descri@@ ption of a landscape .

that means that every at@@ om at the same time in two different places , which at the same time means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .

the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be those they are , without having to change about the will of the state .

we &apos;ve lost the confidence in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science in itself , and there &apos;s no reason why why this shouldn &apos;t be that way .
of course , it &apos;s determin@@ ed there , but not the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , through my time finger , which is now there now .
and i spent 30 days eating eating nothing but this -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
then this community of people who shared this great insi@@ jo@@ ke , and started talking about it and playing with it .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what it takes .
but anyway , it &apos;s now it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a context where it &apos;s much more available .
that means , the whole western civili@@ za@@ tional history is that the city has always been taken , but it &apos;s never given anything to the farmers .
well , he continu@@ on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they were going to eat in the wild .
if you go to this path , where belief and magic re@@ replace evidence and science , you get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about the and@@ ro@@ re@@ cep@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
and i called them up and i ta@@ ta@@ ted your knowledge to compare their exper@@ ti@@ se to what we had found in the code and in the data .
so the idea is , apart from showing that br@@ ands are part of the life , actually get them to fund the film ?
of the people who sta@@ standing when it were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ ands .
in the places that off@@ ban@@ ered almost 60 fund , the participa@@ tion rate is now fell to about the six@@ th percent .
now it turns out that even if you decide to participa@@ te , when there were more possibilities for choice , even then , it has negative consequences .
in fact , this mountain of de@@ br@@ ers is acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated by fis@@ her@@ men every time they drive into areas where they has never fis@@ hed before .
you &apos;ll con@@ fir@@ it , because the evidence they were in an earlier form is not as as you would like to present the evidence .
and so i compared compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ poin@@ ting compared to what i expected .
so in order to reach this 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , need completely completely cover their electricity generation .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve often asked my friends that l@@ ately , and they all wanted wanted to go to the past .
and i &apos;ve probably consum@@ ed from my memor@@ ies of three ##AT##-##AT## @@ week journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med we feel de@@ fe@@ ated . we feel thre@@ at@@ ed , maybe depres@@ sed , maybe fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
and the biggest question i &apos;m recently asked , &quot; did you do this repli@@ repli@@ the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
my current activity is to designing objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i grew up in the country , in ancient , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis was developed , and made al@@ umin@@ um making so cheap that we use it with our thro@@ way ment@@ ality .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business a long time , that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own wrong talk to make this happen .
instead of you having to code , wir@@ it or solve it , li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its allows them to with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so in order to speed the blind or slow down , just turn on that butt@@ on , and it makes the pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point in this morning by telling how much the way in which we ju@@ ged things depen@@ ds on what we compare to .
of course , the question is , what is actually such the intui@@ tive action sche@@ of us humans , and now i &apos;ve mis@@ you it ?
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course we &apos;re sha@@ ped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical physical , emotional or even both .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in the commun@@ ist east germany , you had , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ n it in the government .
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we are the yo@@ unger unger brothers are responsible for the destruction of the world .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we &apos;re reach@@ ing beyond our limit@@ ations , educ@@ ates the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
this is from the u.s. a a network , which is actually more of kind of for@@ um where where you you meet and disc@@ uss online .
they &apos;re a little more technical , and also a little business business , , and then &apos;re asked questions , applied questions .
we can do things now now now that if they s@@ ar away , if they break down , they can them into biological cy@@ cles .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this uni@@ mag@@ vable problem for our che@@ fs , how do we keep fish on our men@@ cards ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine of nuclear things and other things ?
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
of course , this was a great , old syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary . i just thought that the copy had to be pretty old .
why don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability of that n@@ &apos;s face , especially if you can exp@@ and it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
but because it &apos;re missing missing the re@@ cep@@ tors to dete@@ ct the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
it starts with the gender parts , and then the v@@ acc@@ es come , then the bush conver@@ sh@@ tions , and the last people actually do art .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it gets when these dro@@ p@@ let learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
and most of all , i want to say those those of you who see this well , as is , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
by not by participa@@ tion , they give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer who would have been happy to re@@ produce contribu@@ tion .
and the more opportunities there are to choice , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these choice are recogni@@ ded into the op@@ per@@ nel east .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel themselves dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about , they acc@@ use use themselves .
but these oil dro@@ p@@ let weren &apos;t about alive in the sense today , because every one of them was just a little , random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ -- like ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player who met over 400 400 times during a regular seas@@ on .
then their brain waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ on what they thought or how they thought , &apos;s then different lights of lights in the room .
you know , there are a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
anthro@@ pol@@ sts have found that we humans always asked from the members of our society always one one : to be useful and to contribu@@ te .
funny funny , we also had had to break in the par@@ king lot , so we felt in right as part of the spra@@ y scene .
so in a power plant , for example , if the big ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too fast , you have to open de@@ pos@@ ing val@@ ves within within milli@@ seconds .
you can put it all with re@@ mar@@ ks , send your friends , and so you start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educ@@ ated societies because they don &apos;t trust trust the sources of the past .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only i &apos;m going to give is to c@@ amer@@ on , so he turn &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
and i &apos;m saying today &apos;s more likely that we become vic@@ vic@@ ms an online crime than a fra@@ le one in the real world .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , today , as we &apos;re here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , right half of them are not wh@@ is@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
and this is on a upp@@ higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ ship than the trans@@ of a classi@@ cal metaphor metaphor , is is of the des@@ k@@ top .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve taken the part that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s it consum@@ used ur@@ an .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , as well as still some agriculture , hopefully wh@@ for@@ est@@ ation and c@@ ement ement be clean up until then .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for olymp@@ ics 20@@ 12 and dar@@ e@@ ies and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
then she said , &quot; next next imagine you will always do the right thing , &quot; even if &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still increas@@ ed , and our final point would now go to an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
and as we also see things , what we look to , and how we sort of sec@@ ourselves against our environment , so that we can think it accor@@ d@@ ingly .
in the descri@@ ption of my talk , written that i understand as an interpre@@ , i understand as a transl@@ ator , so in the english word d@@ word .
it &apos;s pi@@ vo@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter after a certain cause of death , say say acci@@ dents .
we have to track these brea@@ ks with full gas , and we can measure that : in corpo@@ rate numbers , in pilot projects and regu@@ ance changes .
you can know how satis@@ fied someone is with their lives , and that really really doesn &apos;t teach a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice ver@@ sa .
so if you take a different example , so if you immediately makes a bigger bigger a ha@@ y@@ today , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and nothing to it .
we trust that somebody will spend time with us , that the rules , that we have the same goal , and stay stay to the to@@ ground .
do you have a perspective -- i &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but you know how this this will develop ?
and where you can see , even something like de@@ meter , the most est bio@@ , yes agriculture doesn &apos;t allow our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c to go back .
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , develop something called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , where o@@ vari@@ tissue is wra@@ wra@@ by by sti@@ w tissue .
it seems like our culture took a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic post@@ : &quot; well , we need to draw a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new living block , making the laws there would support such like building and don &apos;t prevent it .
i think that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but that the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated teacher are particularly meaning@@ ful .

you can see , we sur@@ f on the web the first as if it &apos;s really a net , not not just from side to page , but much more abstra@@ ct .
but if we reduce the price down -- let &apos;s cut the price half -- let &apos;s hit a new bar@@ rier and that bar@@ rier is related to co2 .
issue about environmental crisis , a big problem over the last 10 years is that children sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without going out .
and if you have that assu@@ mption in your eyes , you understand the lo@@ gic with with which we experience that happiness to , through a lie improve our world our better .
all you can see in this picture was built in within four years after it took four years to get the per@@ mit@@ sions .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen people three essential negative consequences that off@@ ering more and more choices .
my favorite one is in the middle -- mp@@ 3 play@@ tri@@ bs , nas@@ e ##AT##-##AT## @@ hair tri@@ bers and cr@@ Ã¨@@ me l@@ Ã©@@ e fac@@ kel .
now , this is even more amazing if you imagine that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh@@ gh over 20 tons and shif@@ ted by about 30 in@@ ches .
if i don &apos;t fight the poverty , i fight poverty as a fire@@ fire@@ &apos;s &apos;s use in a volunte@@ er tra@@ g@@ ger@@ te .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as than the woman walking around at ted in her under@@ wear -- that means that i &apos;ve found a few things .
but a li@@ p pen , even in this ligh@@ ting , can i tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but very effective , right ?
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a good thri@@ our@@ ished population of isn not the last thing you want to have on a fish co@@ al ? &quot;
in fact , that if you could only reduce price from one thing , poverty redu@@ ction , energy would far the most effective .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took care of them , and we gave eight on their family because it needed necessary .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who could help me understand what they call the brand person@@ ality .
you saw it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always in the back of it , and we &apos;ve got dollar too little when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
all proteins changed exactly what the mem@@ bran@@ es changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly we trans@@ fer@@ red .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest biggest bi@@ ture , or this was vis@@ to the google page and enter@@ the the page like this .
and i just assu@@ that in the next 30 years , we &apos;ll &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical stor@@ all over the world .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist of los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by i turn myself back , is hidden through this movement that the fing@@ ers will move back again .
why ? this picture pretty much descri@@ bes why i think games are so vi@@ tal to survival of of human species in the future . seriously .
adap@@ tive technologies have i been been able to learn how to sk@@ i , clim@@ b , even even bi@@ el with my hands .
this raised our attention , and we started a lab lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and looked at this ct .
and then we went for ti@@ ckets and data structures and tried tried to connect them to the real world -- with potential tar@@ gets in the real world .
the biggest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ de@@ ation , which makes 20 percent , is to burn fossil fu@@ els .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to then make it about another possibility , about an instrument , to sound .
and by the way , you also &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to bri@@ ges ges and get enjoy when the fire fire ws up the after@@ wards .
and of course , there are teams who have a lot more ta@@ -@@ da shapes , and the best are fresh gradu@@ ates in kinder@@ garten .
i found later later that , around the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
and yes , a lot of what was said today was very tou@@ ched today , because many , lots of beautiful beautiful expres@@ sions that i &apos;ve lived through .
since then , in the 40 years that have now now contro@@ versi@@ ed , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , 500 hours of them in di@@ si@@ bles .

because they went around the middle cl@@ aus , they went around the agen@@ cies , and they said that maybe the agen@@ cies didn &apos;t really have interest in mind .
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t all follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
we pay great attention to new technologies , but the progress it need technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
because at an individual -- at this -- learning now now happened within the period of the li@@ fes@@ pan pan of a single organis@@ m , rather than over this evolutionary period of time .
first , how smo@@ oth she she lost -- good like in bad times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high con@@ jun@@ ture .
you can see this , if we create this kind of vie@@ ws where we can pen@@ et@@ rate through images , and we have this experience of multiple resol@@ ution experience .
that will definitely be an car@@ rier of energy , which then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas or or sch , that that will it be .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you you show a ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ged in ke@@ key su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
so what is it an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are competition in competition for new dents ?
and if you &apos;re on vac@@ ation and somebody brea@@ ks together , whether it &apos;s your relative , or anyone else , you can find such an a@@ ed .
i got big in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ in , and this matri@@ arch@@ in was my grandmother .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l 199@@ 199@@ 9 the full control over an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas combin@@ together .
because if you just read about it , out of dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as you did it yourself or saw it yourself .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 em@@ it@@ ted per unit of energy .
in this way , you can see that anything moves at time time , as long as i press here , nothing can go into my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out .
now i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the life of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is made of more than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to think about about about questions of democracy .
even even though choo@@ ge@@ ge@@ don &apos;t &apos;t tell anything about my pre@@ fer@@ in inter@@ ior equipment , it &apos;s still prepar@@ ing me to choose .
i go to the research prison and i visit a cli@@ ent who might may be 13 or 14 years old and who should be as an adult as an adult .
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you might like hear about any other doctor , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
because in usually , through this new kind of us@@ ability , which is the natural user n@@ ter@@ faces , are are five times faster on average average , are on our goal .
i call it ne@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided from us as individual , in the decisions that we make .

when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble re@@ duced the different head and shoul@@ der species from 26 to 15 , they experienced a increase in sal@@ es es by 10 percent .
what &apos;s important is that a person or group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a stand@@ point , shared with a big audience , and acceler@@ ated the process .
we were told told that if it went over the normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
or if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i study a lot recently , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
if i invi@@ te you to dinner dinner and i say , yeah , there &apos;s a p@@ let with open@@ ness ta@@ stes and there &apos;s a glass of water .
when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create every future in@@ able , and that we can play all kinds of games .
when i found the main man , he had just in a very serious conversation with the house ow@@ ner , which certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
so if a single at@@ om at the same time be in two two different places , can be this piece of metal in two different places , why why &apos;t it her ?
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
we &apos;re light years away from impro@@ people , and our goal is just just that we have a chance to survive long long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
but to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts have have not over the cent@@ u@@ ries not received the call of al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ man@@ ic depres@@ sed people .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ con@@ ed a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed to integra@@ te other chemicals from outside and grow grow .
it got sil@@ ent . then a woman said , &quot; our history , it &apos;s impossible that we ever ever talk back to the syste@@ matic killing people .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning got in la@@ gos on a airplane and just going to los angeles , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
about three or four years ago , i got a the middle of the night got a call from this teacher , m@@ s. post , who said , &quot; i have to see her .
what i want to do is a film about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing where the whole film fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and sing .
it doesn &apos;t work particularly scientific -- she puts a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a and as@@ ks patients , families , rela@@ tives &quot; how is it ?
so let &apos;s go back , which 2.@@ 5 billion years , and the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ le stone cl@@ um@@ p with lots of chemicals flo@@ ating on it .
i remember i had to have been eight or nine , that i wo@@ up up one morning and went to the living room , and all my cou@@ s@@ ins were walking around .
we created a wrong high ##AT##-##AT## @@ resol@@ resol@@ ution display that is much higher than a normal ad , and we ad@@ ded extra content .
but i was very fortun@@ ate to meet him very early , at 10 10 years old , and so i was been on my my school on his clas@@ ses .
so we &apos;re not a battery manufac@@ tur@@ , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s just between the theme of battery and the top@@ ic on the net and everything in between .
and none of these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve now built over hundreds of 50 in the last last 20 years , none of these facili@@ ties ever been s@@ abo@@ ted .
by impro@@ vement , try , and through the study of users , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the basic elements .
when people have freedom , then each of us is for themselves to do the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our public good , and nobody has to decide for us .
and then car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed to me , put a fing@@ ers on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
imagine , for example , your , your wife is sad , if you if you &apos;ve an@@ ed you , and you come at fif@@ ty ro@@ ro@@ ses .
compared to the whole amount of climate condi@@ -@@ changing materials in the atmosphere , that amount wer amount could double if we tran@@ sc@@ end this critical point .
the red thre@@ ad conne@@ cts these all is depen@@ dence on carb@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ based fu@@ els like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
she &apos;s one of the organi@@ a@@ ers here from this great event , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and pri@@ al my idea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center built in south korea , larger than the city of bo@@ st@@ on .
it &apos;s not going to take a long to be the reality that there &apos;s going to be 1,000 $ human genom@@ es , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available for anyone .
if we could print it out with a size of 10 and without circum@@ stances , it would embra@@ ce 14@@ 2 pages pages just to print out this genetic code .
after a time of refle@@ ction , it seems to me that , in order to continue writing , i have to design a kind of sh@@ ctive ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct .
and the machines that do this kind of thing , they &apos;re quite quite expensive that you commer@@ cially buy , the che@@ ap@@ ones go off to four thousand euro@@ s .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s probably not that stupid and it as@@ through itself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
a place where women are leading the reci@@ tor , say to sex &apos; hell@@ o , &quot; and the game determin@@ es the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
so i would feel much better about the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects objects also follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
it also also me me it@@ excited about the big product that i put , and so i &apos;m ready to motiv@@ ate myself myself to be with interest .
and i realized that not only did he have an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ di@@ c knowledge about music , but he also connected ned a ti@@ ght personal relationship .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical , but but not the normal , and would you really to know this poor gra@@ y person person if they were really there ?
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body , which actually represents something very different for us , it conf@@ uses us in terms of these categ@@ ori@@ zation .
these could be a cop@@ per services , or techni@@ cians for example just to make sure that the repor@@ ned a@@ ed is still still in its place .
now there are some among us who kind kind of for@@ gotten that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being being , &quot; really really mean different possibilities of being .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so the computer cker@@ spaces , because the c base in ber@@ lin was the first to tens hundred hundred billion nets .
and i can say this for the reason that we now live in an epidemic of the fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it and will never see again .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ sion of death death of our body in evolution at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
mar@@ ia , in can &apos;t percei@@ see the same right the same right h@@ ein@@ rich has in all states which is the right to cure .
and a kind of digital glo@@ w ur@@ w at night -- but most most importantly , a new kind of experience for anyone who want to go to the top .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard lt ction in the decision , that means that you &apos;re over@@ wh@@ ged , which means , i &apos;ll lose it .
well , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time for us to think about about the world that we want to leave behind our children .
we believe because we &apos;ve taught taught so that the real question is , did did a human deser@@ to die for a crime that they have ?
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ li@@ ty comes from this true orig@@ , also the mir@@ r@@ ors can &apos;t lie , comes out of this true ance@@ val .
and it worked . again , we created something ma@@ gical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played a little more money with the movie .
a human who opened do@@ ors for me was my pe@@ di@@ ri@@ cian at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in del@@ hi .
but do you know what you would be go in , in these a@@ ments and their environment environment laws laws to avoid damage and di@@ stra@@ ct from min@@ ing .
what they find out is that people who go from the many to low low ability par@@ ties over and over again choose standard choice again .
the process fe@@ ds on itself , and so it becomes , i think , car cat@@ aly@@ st is the word for it -- when something incre@@ ases its speed of the change .
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate is , if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l ##AT##-##AT## @@ en@@ cr@@ services , for example , g@@ mail .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters en@@ code about 20 amin@@ amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single regu@@ ation for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
you can be moved with your hand , you can percei@@ ve each other , you can dete@@ ct their mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a radio pi@@ ver .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt of power , and it can get this for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve a sort of simu@@ tional technology .
anyway , the part that had to do with curi@@ osity and science . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curious . it was a imagination .
i think we would all understand the mo@@ od that woo@@ dy all when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get im@@ mortality through my work .
this could be to sna@@ ase up a hy@@ dr@@ ant , h@@ unt wee@@ ds , fli@@ in a tr@@ ash can with a th@@ yl@@ rat .
we go through the same steps that multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular organisms have through -- the abstra@@ ction of our ways that we hold data , present , process data .
and then their pu@@ p@@ p@@ exp@@ exp@@ and , they came in front of your head , then look down and they s@@ wal@@ low , and start telling their stories .
eight years ago , i was at the media , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of the engineers of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
and that &apos;s , yes , , these are usually usually pretty young people , but the only thing that actually ites ites you all all ites , is this fascin@@ ation of the technology .
there &apos;s a survi@@ br@@ s self that lives in the present and knows knows the present , is able to re@@ experience the past , but basically only only has the present .
patient b clearly clearly more ered ered . his gut ction was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had patient b , and more .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and this is , : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t saying it . &quot;
and by the way , if you want to do something about this , write up , &apos;s best in germany by all the facili@@ ties ties that is fr@@ fur@@ t .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , some fear , but also ou@@ ter concent@@ ration , completely pen@@ ded in resol@@ solving a really difficult problem .
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a cover spon@@ sor , but we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies were up and down companies , and who said &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read you , and then i ask you to cla@@ p p if you &apos;re willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s &apos;s and@@ ment .
so the things that make a picture look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
i sat once in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , when he gets a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .

so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans if you want to build a new city , you have to start an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
and if you want to make make make decisions as in@@ formed tive decisions in society and want want to talk to it , you need to have access to knowledge and technology .
over here we &apos;re simul@@ ating the whole trans@@ mission mission system , the kilometers of physics of the c@@ ables to sort of map the bra@@ tional behavior on the web .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ , no connection , none at all .
but then he got older and quie@@ t . he told me that one day he was on a ra@@ high@@ street in los angeles , and that &apos;s where everything changed for him .
if all the fing@@ ers move time and right as it is in the notes , then they come out that together sound like music .
so that &apos;s important because you can just by looking at web@@ sites in this way , look at the entire internet course in the same way .
in the next plan@@ tional elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a tur@@ co@@ very whose program promis@@ ed both new vel@@ tions and sh@@ city .

for me , the best living example of how to do this , musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its , and i could interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to decisions in terms of work , again and again again whether we should work or work not work .
he has x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his side kid@@ ne@@ ys were so much active that they basically created a male hor@@ m@@ one environment .

this is this indi@@ cation that the inside , the bu@@ b already knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that l@@ l@@ oud .
and this is bio@@ curious , which just mentioned ha@@ space space , this one , sort of a vol@@ k@@ sho@@ school essentially for molecular biology .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ i@@ genes , to re@@ ing genes , d.@@ is a , re@@ ding frag@@ ments so that you can make them visible .
what if you could make all the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s , or elimin@@ ate re@@ duc@@ ing the risk of cancer cancer or stro@@ ke ?
and that &apos;s exactly what happened that we shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and our own own production of of our individual memor@@ ies on ex@@ ternal media .
after you &apos;ve first cho@@ sen a piece to play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;ll first research for the up of emergen@@ ce of the com@@ position .

now &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s also not impossible , if you have enough curi@@ osity and put enough energy in in , then you get far there .
and that ability of virtu@@ virtu@@ alize the virtual the reality , people have had people in the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial times in the industrial industrial times because they didn &apos;t had anything at all .

so as you can see , my excited is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that fit better to how our brains and bodies work .
so it kind of of very sad for the ha@@ cker@@ scene , because it &apos;s &apos;t true what it actually started like this , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
now you &apos;re going to wonder , why do all the designers start eng@@ aging with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ical ur@@ forms of communication , inter@@ interaction and so on and so forth ?
now , when we tele@@ phone a couple of weeks ago , they mentioned to me that there was a fairly interesting interesting result that came out of this gall@@ up po@@ ll .

this is brilliant -- there &apos;s brilliant , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that protect you from the consequences of your work .

there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after playing with them , even if they de@@ fe@@ us evil .
the doctor for pr@@ an@@ at@@ al diagno@@ stic of my mother was on vac@@ ation , and so my parents &apos;t know the man who brought me to the world at all .

and he dre@@ back for the first time , in both of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense that that was in the par@@ king lot .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually catch , but i always want to make it look like you could have , in a picture .

i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because they &apos;re coming from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
so if we look at the development of our society society , shor@@ tly shown here , we &apos;re now moving from the third to the fourth social generation or social form .
we have a com@@ ic on it . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local understanding , knowledge net@@ working working , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
believe you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study going with v@@ acc@@ ine versus influ@@ enz@@ a that was built in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
of course , the problem is that as we start to look at all the common@@ ties , we need to start questi@@ question why we susta@@ tain certain separ@@ ations .
some re@@ f@@ use to give up bra@@ ckets to the bit@@ ter end , while others are no longer it and cr@@ as@@ collapse in an sei@@ dent of dra@@ matic passion .
so , that really brought my interest , and we started working , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to provide all the people in this audience an all@@ -@@ inten@@ ded vac@@ ation to the most beautiful street in the world .

and then on a clou@@ dy day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds , and the sun broke down , and i said , maybe i can feel better again .
and even if the answer to the question is no , &quot; is it certainly certainly shape your experience of your child &apos;s foot@@ ball game very different than it had been .
because , as said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and there have no chance to form themselves really well at there .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ at me and say , &quot; what does it care about ? let people do what they want .
i came to the reali@@ zation as a doctor that i was working to a goal that was different from the goal of evolution -- not inevi@@ t@@ ably ably dis@@ tradi@@ stent , only different .
today , you can transport a sequence of the three base pa@@ irs of the human genome at a price of about $ $ 20@@ ,000 and into the space of about about a week .
some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ 1 race , then they took their budget , and they put their money on a good dri@@ driver and a good car .
in a world where video days is video plo@@ plo@@ plo@@ aded every every minute , only really unique and un@@ expected can emer@@ ge like the videos i mentioned .
just remember that a mas@@ sa@@ i war with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , has a better mobile communication than president re@@ ag@@ an 25 years ago .
now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ , like this plant here .

and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to throw out all the mit travel@@ out .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make the piece of metal are still there and at the same time the same atoms move up and down .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send them to their doctor , and share it with other others , a little more than 100 dollars .
and it works in a medical culture that recogni@@ recogni@@ zes that people fill system with life , and if that &apos;s that , people also make mistakes from time to time .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able dist@@ ingu@@ es a memory self from a survi@@ vor itself . time has very little impact on this story .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ -- you don &apos;t have to put put the user up over a us@@ b@@ - stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in stu@@ x@@ net .
the basic idea of this company was to ski@@ p the phase of y processes with op@@ tic inter@@ ters , etc . and start with digital produ@@ ctions .
you have to separate two things clearly : for example , the medical fact of being am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated and for other the social opini@@ on about whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine the stuff , because if you imagine the stuff all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got the most feedback , or where i had the biggest success are the ones where i inter@@ ac@@ directly with things .
and because we &apos;re nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all of the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral be be the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
to make sense of that conversation , of course , i had know something about this remarkable belief of dou@@ n , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a cul@@ t the black magic .
so i went to buy new je@@ ans after many years of old old gene , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like some je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be full of ras@@ sing if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning beginning that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence came from you .
we di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed almost to 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome was the shift from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology the digital world of computers .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s highest , not to be there , right ?
and this &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad er we talked with re@@ com@@ men@@ ded their custom@@ ers to leave their fing@@ ers .
i spend most lot of my time with the so@@ cially we@@ ak@@ ness in the social construction sett@@ le@@ ments and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .

what they pro@@ was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they re@@ placed it by another one that was radical and beautiful beautiful , and 200 200 years was designed for us .

and in the end , we &apos;re face a choice . would we live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of the mon@@ ot@@ ony or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?

do you remember car@@ car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger space vehicle in 199@@ 0 , when it passed saturn , back to towards earth ?
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want people people happy , practice that coura@@ ge to lie .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted , and sometimes we went to two to three months in three back of each other .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;ll close my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ e@@ ve or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
and maybe we can create of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence as something natural , co@@ her@@ ent useful useful and we don &apos;t feel so bled by this by their pres@@ ence .
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people people the opportunity to stand tain nam@@ name rights at my ted@@ talk 2011 .
the reason for felt worse was , with all these possibilities available , my expec@@ tations of what a good good few je@@ ans went up .

a string com@@ il@@ der , if you make it full with water , it has enough pressure , so i think , about 40 to six six@@ ty bar on it .
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were sort of like the discussion that i &apos;ve been had in the last 30 30 years on the theme of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .

his job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted less than a billi@@ on@@ a a second after the beginning of the universe -- and up to 600 million times within a second .
that is , we just ju@@ u@@ ze our vision before we then see it , we put it back to the back into our se@@ le@@ device , to say , ok ?
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ oh &quot; -@@ moments than others , and among the worst dest ones are fresh b@@ w@@ l gradu@@ ates .
we &apos;re going to have a process that usually requires possibly requires 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it to a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .

finally , this older black man , with a very concerned fac@@ ial , came to the cour@@ tro@@ room , and sat down right behind me , almost on the defen@@ se bank .
it &apos;s about how you en@@ counter people in inter@@ media so that they use these inter@@ active media and so that they create a incredibly satis@@ fying experience .
i personally fin@@ saying that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take a com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
so an organis@@ m could , for example , not eat a particular fru@@ it because she ta@@ bad and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
in nine people that we ex@@ ecu@@ ted , one that we thought thought was inno@@ cent that was de@@ char@@ pped and pped from the death cell .
if i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance i don &apos;t mean a life of lux@@ ury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
i was se@@ vent@@ h at then when i shared back on one of his ses ses , and played the last one of the four ch@@ op@@ in ch@@ op@@ in , a late piece .
but the measu@@ re@@ ment hit quite back , and the people in my company told me that we were pre@@ cur@@ ably able to do that .
and sometimes a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is it takes to take us from a u@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ oh &quot; to a ta@@ -@@ da moment .
i mean , it can sound strange about think that one thing at the same time time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed them .
and we have that then it &apos;s not wired , but that &apos;s yeah , i think , has done pretty well thing , people are quite convinced of like this .
so then i stood back to a little team on un@@ un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
we have to lead these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we need to think but if we get to the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be gla@@ d to done that .
the head of con@@ gress came to the stage and said said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but could we look at the ted@@ talk .
so i decided to go to visit the fi@@ li@@ all@@ ter , and i asked the leader , &quot; does this model work that you really give people all these possibilities ? &quot;
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ load and 1.@@ 3 percent of the staf@@ f of health care .
we want to encoura@@ ge the world of cre@@ ators , the inv@@ ent@@ ors , of contribu@@ passionate , , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world bel@@ on@@ gs to us .
we &apos;re going to turn it on and we expect expect collect first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue our journey to figure out what are the building blocks of the universe .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it up for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n you dig without all the complex ties .
how you can increase happiness is a very depen@@ dent on how they think , and whether you think about the memory self , or whether they think about the living vor themselves .
but lat@@ est dna evidence show that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ cians , who later formed the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re dete@@ ct the same dna as the old ly@@ di@@ ans .

well , there are play@@ ful brand and ei@@ ful br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but a play@@ , ei@@ ght ##AT##-##AT## @@ ful brand is a pretty strong thing .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear them talk like way . &quot;
it &apos;s still a very happy con@@ conc@@ ert if i can have the experience to the piece that i worked so long in ad@@ v@@ ance like new .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend the first sentence would was wrong in wrong , as of course you have to take the opposite without evidence .
it seems like we &apos;re quite quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually for the of it , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms our cells are pretty equal .
in a country that has just a major crisis behind , was ele@@ cted ele@@ gress for this change in expression at 1@@ 24 to a voice .
when i was an graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very very ex@@ clu@@ sive gro@@ store , at least back it was really ex@@ clu@@ sive .
but these app@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government who pay ta@@ xes and recei@@ ve services .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst er@@ r@@ only in the first first five years what argu@@ ed to many of my colleagues , but is total non@@ sense .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do this , and we would come back and all images on the walls would have liked gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tis .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right the now , building the co@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ fi@@ red plants plants because we otherwise don &apos;t , or ga@@ stur@@ bin@@ , because it doesn &apos;t work .
according bur@@ r@@ elle , the pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million phone calls from this film .
but this kee@@ ps me wake at night -- one of the things that keep me wake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as ur@@ gent as now , never before .
in fact , we start from a new point : we di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a a new phase of biology by designing and and build new life .
so what was a a problem for these re@@ tors tors what we put in ours , and so the waste me is dra@@ matically re@@ duced during this process .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re involved in elimin@@ ating the dan@@ gers that others only do when they just put fire .
so we take something very complicated , we conver@@ t it into sounds , a sequence of sounds , and we produce produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preser@@ ving the people we love from f@@ ate@@ y beat kes , but also pre@@ p@@ are them to get well with it .
and it turns out that if you create something to feel con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool , so that you can get people to save more .
i told my wife , whenever a human being uses the moral justi@@ fication the word word , we should try to replace it with the word word .
i love to find find different color@@ ful fit to every opportunity , crazy out@@ fit at every opportunity , and also also to photograph and blog@@ ging recently .
how about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed wher@@ ever you are , give a voice to pay attention to yourself and create change for the first time ?
now , in eg@@ y@@ pt , the sur@@ sur@@ lo@@ lo@@ ed in apri@@ l 2011 , the eg@@ eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an intelligence agen@@ ters , and they found a lot of recor@@ ds .
i think that molecular biology , general , now so in general speaking speaking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count to do it , syn@@ thetic biology , and so on .
they didn &apos;t coun@@ pt because he had rema@@ ined with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was everything he had gotten to keep tain .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing a own , unique , personal personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral sk@@ ul@@ l of universe is very vi@@ sive , but it &apos;s incre@@ ins justice .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services , within a decade that can posi@@ tively cover the lives of billions of billions of people .
a process that , -- as anyone knows who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- in other words , actually everyone here -- not always reas@@ on@@ able .
and our european connected network is basically just made of l@@ ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of great power plants , where ever the wave is turning all over europe .
and something interesting happened happened , because what fascin@@ ated me about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ aus shows , was the idea of a a completely un@@ known world here our earth itself .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you heard about , the stron@@ gest psycho@@ active pre@@ ate from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ ame .
already transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can require more knowledge , too when it comes to den@@ poetry or even to poetry .
i can sound al the sounds today that the b@@ ach has had on the modern wing , which a b@@ aro@@ ck@@ ared c@@ em@@ bal@@ o .
but also also appropriate , because it turns out , by using all this time for play , we actually change what we &apos;re capable of human beings .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i would take several months to plan it , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
so these are just some of the cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- but it could have been the last last six days , or the last six years .
and i negoti@@ ated with me that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ perfe@@ ction and never gave a mistake once again , that the voice voice could m@@ you .
the reason is that everything used to be better when everything was worse when everything worse , it was possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we may be creating a new form of cam@@ brian explosion where there might be massive new bio@@ gery based on this digital design .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all of you who weren there at the time , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment that was ever done -- 27 kilometers e@@ average .
because it makes as much sense as everything else that i &apos;ve heard about about expla@@ to ining the absolutely crazy cap@@ ri@@ ri@@ ty of the creative process .
i talked l@@ oud , &quot; listen , thing , you and i both know , if this book isn not brilliant , that it &apos;s not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
and there we trouble trouble at the media cam@@ pus , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ . , and we can actually do this all the time .
we started talking about music about music , and a few days days later , i got an email saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in teaching education in me .
we all what we had at the time . if we read a book as children , we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ and project them on the can@@ v@@ as in our heads .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with inter@@ sexual people whose gender is at@@ yp@@ ical -- so people who don &apos;t have average male or fe@@ female body types .
and if you &apos;ve already you that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net and high ##AT##-##AT## @@ tech , let me tell you , the us@@ data is a science for itself .
are you reli@@ able , stable , family family , safe , na@@ yed , hol@@ y , consi@@ fied like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
and because the government ultimately ultimately sharing its power from us -- remember you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
how would it feel like to living in a world where the ger@@ man state made people people down , especially if there were in@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate lot of je@@ ws ?
at this point , and when you lau@@ gh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to need to experience something that artists can share with us very well .
what that means is that if you hit someone , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two ##AT##-##AT## @@ man , how much would you know about their size ?
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s in a couple of days , and then spread from sel@@ rare , is a kind of k@@ is@@ in before the bay in the government institution .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to face us the big challenges of our planet .
we now have , from our disco@@ ver@@ around the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components in the future .
they st@@ star@@ out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded chan@@ n@@ els , and that den@@ sity , l@@ ush mar@@ ch .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , , say , in climate .
but then another happened , very interesting step , where things got completely different , which that cells cells started to communicate and exchange information , so that communities of cells came .
let &apos;s go back back to my world of medicine , where i feel about a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less comfortable after i talked to you about you .
basically , you get every round on every si@@ ft@@ er rand@@ om@@ ly re@@ ted letters , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re te@@ cked over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
well , i was phone to some people in the company , and nobody could give me a extraordinary answer , until i finally tele@@ phones to the sen@@ tive bi@@ ist .
if i tell you that somebody or@@ dered their life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a of inse@@ curity about how happy he is with their living itself .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that lets us explore and interact , and the un@@ expected wir@@ es that we form are are the real nutri@@ ground of creativity .
one of the areas where we see this to the game game in our current culture , in the current united states , are the fighting for the beginning and the end of life .
in the last 100 years , average average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled , inf@@ lation adap@@ ted average average of the world &apos;s population tri@@ pl@@ ed .

we can take a step further and then ar@@ range the data , and see that cular cular and cancer are the common sus@@ pe@@ cts , not for everyone .
my wife , my kids and i have moved to the garage , and these ha@@ cker and mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ cy theor@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts have taken over our house .
in other , the the page entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the community is is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or making something new of it .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in over@@ plus so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
and if we succe@@ it , of course , we we come for adi@@ ity , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came to our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of mira@@ cles we could never imag@@ ined before .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us in his &quot; i &apos;ve talked a dream , &quot; a kind of solution . &quot;
and so i think of myself one of the people , along with most other other experiment@@ quant@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good propor@@ of gic to bring the complex ideas together .
i got a traffic ti@@ ti@@ cket because i haven &apos;t go on the bi@@ ke way , but often often there dis@@ challenges that don &apos;t let you drive on the bi@@ ke way .
maybe i wanted to be successful successful and able to take responsibility responsibility that i was negoti@@ ating , and so i would be able to provide my patients without having to contact it .
just as you knew in the village then , who has something with whom and when , that &apos;s what happens about this exten@@ sion of our self through these mobile end devices at a global level .
and because there were no video games or that over@@ sat@@ u@@ ration of computer@@ gener@@ ated movies , or all the ima@@ language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , black@@ -@@ gener@@ zing things that are very cheap , we have 20 years years to inv@@ ent , and then 20 years to use .
b@@ g : well , the the actual spending on the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
and imagine if i &apos;ve negoti@@ negoti@@ ated dr. p@@ . as a five ##AT##-##AT## @@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old child and trying to stop these practice , naturally naturally without success .
but it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs and get them to play some kind of game to better control their health .
now , what i hear all the time : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
a lot of journ@@ alists called me to the question , &quot; what are you going to that tells us if ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female female or male ? &quot;
and intui@@ tive us@@ ability is not only since apple , is a fundamental economic factor , a fundamental factor of success , if i want to just use technologi@@ cal devices us@@ to human beings .
that means the interpre@@ t needs to trans@@ late these ex@@ act act es of the emergen@@ cy language into another different , audi@@ audi@@ ble con@@ cre@@ te , non@@ verb@@ al music language .
and so we decided to build a a hall in ber@@ lin , where we can sort of map form the electrical ics of the island at scale scale one three three very carefully .
so far in discus@@ sions have always been tried , these insu@@ lin , they make au@@ tar@@ k , they have their own little net , it has nothing to to do with our al@@ und .

the other note says whether we &apos;re using zer@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ emissions technology , whether it used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re able to get it to the rest .

that means , instead of remem@@ i@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , common , mas@@ ses wi@@ common patterns of memor@@ ies that we can hang our personal memor@@ ies .
of course , the chance in rand@@ rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ cted tions is very small that by inci@@ inci@@ dence they sort numbers , so probably none of the in@@ struc@@ tions will actually do this .

it looks like this way , who has no freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and cla@@ ims can be responsibility , and and it &apos;s therefore un@@ compu@@ table able .

if people were to take this fund , i mean , it seems to put everything on their head , everything we think , for example , in terms of ta@@ x policy and so on .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we study whether we can use stor@@ ed co2 , which could just be brought to production stor@@ es , cont@@ ver@@ ant the co2 in a fuel to drive this process .
we should call them what it is , a a business in paper , a commercial that quickly gives e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that allows exactly that production .

i think the most remarkable thing of the last few years , the last decades , that we &apos;ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .

that our system also has a price price is because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with dies@@ oil , and we don &apos;t make price re@@ ces on the other things .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty pretty obvious , at least those of us who have travel@@ ed to these dist@@ ant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .

and second , we as a species , we have con@@ figu@@ uring ed our environment that we &apos;ve managed them to ada@@ pt to us just as we ada@@ pt to them .
this has never been been before in the history of technology development , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth by which the zes order increas@@ increasing exponenti@@ ally years every few years .

of course , the stories that i was looking for from the science fi@@ ction area : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss .
now , very brie@@ fly , another reason that we can &apos;t think clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and if we actually live .
ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m is the desire to immediately do something , to master a bar@@ rier , together with the belief that we have a establi@@ unding hope for success .
it &apos;s out that these connections , your connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound profound and weird of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
we have hard hard time to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .

i &apos;ve let some people count the number of books that were published with happiness in ti@@ tle in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 , and there was much more more .
they were notion that people who had political power should should have this political power because of the blood line of the grand@@ father to son and so on .

arm@@ strong twi@@ we@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us , as one of the 50 best best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really great .
there &apos;s a huge marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption medi@@ es for people like you and me that if you think about it , makes no sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ di@@ v@@ ine experience mind that comes out of a dist@@ , un@@ known source to people -- for un@@ explan@@ ined , un@@ known reasons .
and i then pus@@ ed me in the mi@@ &apos; 8@@ 0s to ber@@ lin , because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ ables , and that didn &apos;t exist in kar@@ l@@ s@@ r@@ t .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is determin@@ by the fight of the human mind , to change through conflict .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o that in in one case the sper@@ m has a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m that hits the x chromo@@ some of the ice cell .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that looks like all all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ are actually just ell@@ ant objects that are made together in a small space .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people around the country standing up and writing government app@@ s , every day in their own communities .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic , con@@ ran@@ ked building blocks to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
and the deep@@ est of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and master the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
now , in our city , where volunte@@ ers support a highly quali@@ fied professional fire@@ men , you have to be quite early early in the brand@@ f f to join te .

no longer a building that would open open to let it in , but a building that still had brea@@ ks and holes in in the water , you had to jump without getting we@@ t .
i had to make sure that it hadn &apos;t been free , it was my job was to learn that the story was tried to cr@@ ush us , but we passed it .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems of why everyone -- maybe most most of the electr@@ onic health projects are missing because we &apos;ve stopped listening listening .
now , with all our digital devices that show us seven days a week , 24 hours a day all these negative news , it &apos;s not wonder cle being p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
and we &apos;re starting by taking the waste that already already exists , which is in these fri@@ ger@@ ators or dry contain@@ contain@@ ers in the re@@ ac@@ tors . that &apos;s our starting fuel .
it dem@@ ands that we all all put our senses on the task and we use our thinking opti@@ mal , like our emotions and our do in the challenge that lies before us .
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to tell you some of the lessons that i believe it or not , have learned from these ad@@ vent@@ ures to wear nothing new .
but tomorrow , it can to face the challenges challenges -- think of it about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we then move from the digital world to the physical ?
the dri@@ vers for mov@@ moving objects are not just humans , but but also the light that seems to them and the wind that kno@@ ps over to them and the heat of the space .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this one , for example , a scan of the library of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ x@@ els .

i meet all kinds of great great people ; my dollars usually serve a good good purpose ; i look pretty quite unique , and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing my personal personal jo@@ p .
and when you play with your particles , you find all kinds of strange things -- like that you fly directly through walls , or that you can be at the same time in two different places .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like like as many other that we often meet in our field , are a kind of straight now in a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ ve .

all you have to do is to look at the bit@@ ter death rates of really great minds just from the 20th century , which died young and often from their own hand .
right now , we &apos;re building building cor@@ n and we lose between 11 and 30 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of 30 ty tons per he@@ c@@ ct@@ are , or also ating it to the square meter .
that &apos;s true of la@@ y@@ ies thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as conf@@ used as anyone else .
i would re@@ write it this way : not the stron@@ gest of its species survi@@ , and also not the most test one of its species , but the one that can best ada@@ pt to change .
so when i knew i was going to come here in in a ted@@ talk , the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going to do a little different .
in fact , they looked obje@@ c@@ tively , when first first had more information than the second time , but i would d@@ are to guess that they felt it real for the second time .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ let , which had an more opti@@ m@@ mal com@@ com@@ position grew faster than others and integr@@ ated more and more chemicals from outside and divi@@ ded faster .
the cial do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our goal is ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being of our citizens , it &apos;s about ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual .
we have fu@@ els from the second and third generation that will come out relatively soon that will have much higher sugar sugar hol@@ ties , like oc@@ tan@@ ium or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been because of these arch@@ a@@ ical models are able to speak very , very different , even though we now use a co@@ di@@ fied language .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that conne@@ to the autis@@ m epidemic with the mas@@ ers , mu@@ mp@@ s , and ro@@ man v@@ acc@@ ine .

if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it &apos;s clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a ali@@ alist world .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will disc@@ uss whether they want to explore experience happiness or whether they want to explore life gra@@ view , so we to lead that discussion pretty soon .

we &apos;re starting to take the voice of the leadership into two sequen@@ cing si@@ ft@@ ers and organi@@ ze it in a row , exp@@ tend it and add a little more of the voice .
and my friends who make big , giant hollywood hollywood films that the reason their films are so successful because the brand part@@ ners they have .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of ima@@ points that you can go on and move through through through that you can look at from many , many direc@@ tions .
now , after i cho@@ se government , &quot; i know that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ac@@ at@@ categ@@ ories that most cover about with it time zin@@ es are people of the year . &quot;
now , if we manage to com@@ sa@@ ate the systems that control revol@@ d numbers and val@@ ves , we can actually do a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ ge .
if you look at who we were and how life sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives had come to the outside .
so we set it to the upp@@ upp@@ of of , to spend a consi@@ tial amount of money to get an ad action on the way , to get the truth about coal .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this six@@ pack be@@ er with grab@@ bed my sister and me and went to us to the forest .
so these communities started to evol@@ forward , so that the level on which evolution took place was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community , which we call organis@@ m .
we have to deal with the un@@ stopp@@ separ@@ ation by death , so it should surprise us that we all sing dance and produce art .
i have a company that makes design and anima@@ tion , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we ad@@ re and pay to in the art world .
the user is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ged the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear energy program will del@@ ay -- the mission mission per@@ formed .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ cted chemical and put it a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteri@@ um started reading the genetic code and made vi@@ ral particles .
so very , very exciting processes , which then be in this , yes , gra@@ u actually actually not y , but there &apos;s just in this red mass , accor@@ appropri@@ ingly .
that means , if we look at that we can trans@@ mit exi@@ action models from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can pick it up as a shape .
and the wind@@ power plant or or solar plant , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only store in small quanti@@ ties here .
and this is kind of of our vision of a sensi@@ ble energy supply , and i &apos;m also cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ cra@@ d@@ le that they said to use solar energy .

first of all , we called the in@@ sur@@ ance called the do@@ ors , and we actually got a device for the p@@ t that he can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ haw@@ king machine .

my father , for example , was a chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation his 40 years as a chem@@ ist where he was asked if he was afraid to be a chem@@ ist .
so we have a whole par@@ par@@ alle@@ l education system here where young people learn the same way what it means to be a good player , as anything else the that they &apos;re learning in school .
and the reason would for that that we &apos;ve been , by medicine , we managed to get a lot of genes that would otherwise otherwise been sel@@ ec@@ ted and would have been re@@ moved from the population .

and at the end of the day , i pack my things , i read the hospital and went to the par@@ king lot to go home with the car when i did something that i otherwise didn &apos;t do .
so if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer to people would be , ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t about that , because i &apos;m a good zen .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in different ways and in different research places -- that you can just use in your business .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that all everything i &apos;m going to write now is r@@ ated by the world as the work that came after the de@@ lin@@ ed success of my last book , right ?
we have all these super@@ s , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to to ti@@ ght social nets , ur@@ gen@@ gen@@ ability optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i started to do something with muse@@ ums and art , and my bo@@ ss , who is also today , gave me green light .
and it wasn &apos;t when he turned 19 old , he got enough medical problems , in fact because he was stru@@ ing inside that the physi@@ cians found that he was female inside inside .
i have the impres@@ sion that if we make vac@@ ation , that is very often the case , that means we make vac@@ ation ation gely gely in the service of the memory itself .
. do i understand it right ? your software allows you at a certain point , over the next years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world together to basically connected together ?
just the things that run away , like sho@@ e sol@@ es , like bra@@ m@@ bra@@ es , like car or@@ es , they have to be be that they go to biological systems .
we can watch our kids playing soc@@ foot@@ ball , and we have our cell phone on the one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on other hi@@ ps , and our laptop probably on our la@@ p .
i know you &apos;ll ask , &quot; how how do we solve problems real world real games ? &quot; and that that question , i &apos;ve de@@ vot@@ ated my work in the years at the institute for the future .
so it &apos;s just like it is in hollywood movies , where during the pur@@ su@@ ing ase unt the sur@@ ei@@ ance camera is is f@@ ed with before before video foot@@ age .
that means , obser@@ vation , if you know that that now pay attention at who you look at how long , because i don &apos;t take any wat@@ se for it , which then what can happen accor@@ d@@ ingly .
so more likely the people who decided to participa@@ te , more the more more they they available them , the more they r@@ ded they to choose active and fund and fund .
and so , my pri@@ mate ra@@ des , let &apos;s embra@@ this gift of evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover the creativity of cr@@ ony and the wonder .
a collea@@ gue of mine mine had access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant f@@ on@@ on@@ society of about a million fellow workers and about 2,000 different jobs .
we find all sorts of species here that took a second chromo@@ some , or a third one of somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of characteri@@ stics every in just a second to a species .
it doesn &apos;t difference . it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we believe to see , which causes we causes us to feel real .
so crazy , of course , this may in the context of my talk , because we physi@@ cally move moving into not exi@@ sting , virtual worl@@ ds , just after the role model of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .
we know them as &quot; love instead of war mon@@ keys , because they have common , also bis@@ ex@@ ual sex with inter@@ changing part@@ ners , and rules confli@@ cts and social fishing .
so i came up with the need to just to make a check , and instead i hi@@ posed a check that i didn &apos;t have the easi@@ est idea how to solve it .
there are also also some nice ways in education like as languages , mathematics or lo@@ gic games , where we give people the ability of fast trial ror and want to see the results immediately .
we put games in to es@@ out of everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying in real life , and we &apos;re getting at what we need from the games .
if we don &apos;t treat a human li@@ cally , and not percei@@ and recognize all of its forces and possibilities , we create in addition to the natural struggle that might need to lead , another disease .
these are the first shoes where you can put the ca@@ v@@ er@@ start on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an light , and the b@@ can go into biological cy@@ cles , right ?
and the third is is concent@@ rational illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affec@@ ts well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its meaning .
maybe the concept that &apos;s right now that just pay attention at what &apos;s broken in one , and how we fix that , for each individual is a greater dis@@ ability than path@@ ology on itself .
take two programs , and they produce kids through exchange exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ ill the fe@@ stics of su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to engage in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are lots of people who would like to live there .
tele@@ ony , computers , video recor@@ es , c@@ d ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve built in our community to hand@@ this information .
the beauty is about the top@@ is that on this island , , you can actually away all the of problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables .
and i &apos;ll keep playing and again with na@@ than@@ iel , whether in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney ney conc@@ ert hall or in sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ t that this thing we own , and whom we pay to be something that works against us , something else , and then we turned ourselves .
one project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land itself was that we wanted to tin@@ ble what we call an op@@ tical tra@@ or an op@@ tical pin@@ c@@ ette .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , suff@@ ered a break@@ down , and 30 years later , he lived as hom@@ eless person on the streets of sk@@ row in the center of los angeles .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , which was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it clean . i don &apos;t like it cr@@ m@@ y .

s@@ nu@@ cking this po@@ w@@ der is sort like sho@@ shot out of a race , surro@@ unded by b@@ aro@@ que painting and the land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
now , the ex@@ act relationship between between carbon co2 rise , and therefore change ting temperature change , and where their other consequences are , there are some ambi@@ gu@@ ties , but not very many .
if in an environment where the adults are active music , or at least hear music , a child gro@@ ws up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color color does your flo@@ wer have ?
i &apos;ve developing developing video now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as to save it in online games .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future , when we continue democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- to think less about the individual body in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
the average for most of them is about 50 in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students create half of them , law@@ a a little more , but not much , children garten garten children are better than the adults .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the survi@@ vor@@ s itself and the happiness of memory itself has been recogni@@ zed in the last years , and now you &apos;re strug@@ gl@@ ed measure the two separ@@ ately .
every dollar was ad@@ ded , and it was put another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to pay for it , mostly these were new things , they always came from second hand .

after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay okay , i to put my main prof@@ ession as a film@@ maker in hollywood , and i become a l ##AT##-##AT## @@ time cher for a while . &quot;
and if that lu@@ f@@ th@@ also then po@@ ur itself across humans , then it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that can only live , yes with with sou@@ l .
the little thing that we ad@@ ded to was that we asked people to just of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
now you might think that the problem looked at people who sur@@ ely , when they lived in predat@@ ors societies , they killed animals , who were only aware of a few generations of what they had done .
well , of course , in a way , these kinds acci@@ dents again spar@@ k the debate about the value of science and engineering engineering at those boundar@@ ies . it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct like this .
and to be honest , the only real and rema@@ ining dis@@ ability that i had to put myself apart is that the world is constantly meant that it could describe me with these defini@@ tions .
and so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who meant that we had to to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to pro@@ mote our country .
and there , another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who had seen after wife prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and these three words , most of the emergen@@ cy cy physi@@ cians i know .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of the i@@ pad and through aug@@ mented reality a anima@@ tion of 11 that appear on a plant in front of the house .
and this really gives you the pleasure and and the good experience to read a paper out@@ very of a magazine magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several orders of tude .
this is the greatest time that has ever been on this planet , no matter what scale they grow : health , wealth wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ lin@@ ing disease rates .
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they went went together , and which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community repe@@ ated more of the often and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution .
now , the bra@@ in@@ d@@ l epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d struggle between the ad@@ vo@@ cate of gene@@ tically engine@@ ed food and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ tes .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we throw away doesn &apos;t just disappe@@ ar , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
the transition place is now now where these communities communities so so close to the that they decided decided re@@ write the pres@@ cri@@ ption for the whole community in a dra@@ et@@ chain on the dna .
here in the picture on the left left see bio@@ sphere , which is ha@@ cker@@ space , which is basically a kind school , so a private school , non@@ profit facili@@ facili@@ ty , where everybody can come .
us@@ ability always means how can i possibly achieve a certain goal quickly , or how can a user in a certain use context to effectively effective effici@@ efficient and satis@@ fac@@ ately ?
it started with a question of the ma@@ yo@@ r who came to us and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public places part of public architecture .

so so if we go to the area of software , this is the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces that were abstra@@ ct ct where you took months to deal with these systems .
this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve managed to the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the same electricity electricity -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .

the cool@@ est about this is -- and this close the whole circle -- that will this apri@@ l , in the meeting mo@@ ca in the inner city of los angeles an exhi@@ bi@@ called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
in this case , we con@@ con@@ red three si@@ ft@@ ables as color sounds , and i can use them to po@@ ur color in the middle , where they &apos;re mix@@ ed .
we should use the produ@@ c@@ tivity action to get redu@@ ction to the way , the less we em@@ it@@ it , the lower the carbon sum will be , and therefore the temperature .
what &apos;s happening is obvious that money doesn &apos;t give you an experience happiness , but that lack of money certainly give you you mis@@ ery able , and we can measure mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that that if we spend 10,000 hours with g@@ arb@@ ful study of a given top@@ ames to the 21@@ st of year , we &apos;ll going to master .
this year , we cele@@ br@@ te the 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution years ago , darwin , in my eyes , refer@@ to something very true in the human character .
so if i look around this room and i see people who who have reach@@ ed a min@@ respe@@ able success , or are on their way there , i want to offer a remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
it unless you &apos;re very brie@@ fly before a break@@ of break@@ , and you just fund the learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to to be much che@@ aper .
they went away from explan@@ ations of super@@ natural species , and pro@@ ved things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back back where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ tive concep@@ ts of birth right .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a image , we can do something like this to really show that this is real repres@@ entation of the text and no image .

he &apos;s still associ@@ ated , because of his earlier stories , with the skep@@ tic@@ tic@@ i camp , but he he understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group , and so he now makes the research argument .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ de in my hospital had taken off the wrong leg somebody , they believe me i had problems to see him in the eyes .
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy fro@@ ed ed up up the s@@ wis@@ s account of mr. sam ja@@ in in here , and on this account there were 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
you know , we really have -- modern tar@@ gets like re@@ plac@@ ing the pe@@ tro@@ tro@@ chemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? to become a main source of energy .
but we wri@@ ters seem to have this kind of call tation but not only the wri@@ ters , but the creative tives of all geni@@ us , seem to have this repu@@ tation to be ment@@ ally incredibly un@@ stable .
and once you have once have have that way to feel that tri@@ sentence in other people , do it , because you &apos;ll make others happy if you don &apos;t don &apos;t remember your self ##AT##-##AT## @@ lies .
the dr@@ one er argu@@ ac@@ active on the gra@@ y box , when a special con@@ con@@ figu@@ ration , , even when the specific program that tries trying to infe@@ is going on this goal .
it doesn &apos;t matter matter difference because the only thing can restri@@ row the performance of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any moment , and it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
and so you get an idea of , if you go information in in this way , tar@@ ted , wi@@ der , you zo@@ om in , , zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t look for or you don &apos;t just brow@@ se .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward to actually syn@@ thes@@ thes@@ ze this chromo@@ some that allows allows us to v@@ ate the individual components and therefore ask some of these fundamental questions .
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ com@@ li@@ ed the the attac@@ ff@@ ing code , and we found that it &apos;s struc@@ tured into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller one and a larger one .
and from that sou@@ l you now think that it &apos;s kind of present in this dy nature , in this funny cent nature , anim@@ a , it &apos;s in la@@ tin , the lu@@ f@@ th@@ as the lu@@ f@@ th@@ also .
today , for the for the first time -- and the campaign ob@@ am@@ as shown this -- we can change from from the digital world , from the self ##AT##-##AT## @@ organi@@ organi@@ zing forces of the networks to the physical world .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we &apos;ve bought on the beach and@@ ing men@@ ade of ven@@ ice , a little cop@@ per wire and a few things from the hard@@ ming market and electr@@ on@@ ics trade .
if the stupid di@@ v@@ ine geni@@ us that you &apos;re put on the side is , for a short moment , to show a bri@@ ck of wonder through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; ol@@ Ã© ! &quot;
but the nin@@ th largest super@@ market , the nin@@ &apos;s largest super@@ market in the world is al@@ al@@ di , and they give them only 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ ses .
the ter@@ ra@@ power@@ concept means that instead of having a part of the ur@@ an , the one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
instead of it &apos;s just quie@@ t t there , it vi@@ br@@ , and the way it vi@@ br@@ was sort of the like this one -- like an exp@@ t@@ ing ing and together educ@@ sing bar .
and i used this ch@@ art to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york , and remember that an area in some cases per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
and if you tell people people when you tell people to exist it , if you say that would be better , you weren &apos;t there at all , they become re@@ e@@ cky and ho@@ sti@@ le .
in fact , it l@@ ked so much about self ##AT##-##AT## @@ confidence that i asked the nur@@ se who took care of woman &apos;s prin@@ ter , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when she comes home ? &quot;
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just exactly the same size , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on what context we put things .
o@@ sit o@@ sit on it &apos;s about 50 to seven seven thousand times from us ever get on activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve been noticed that then it &apos;s less often often pun@@ ted than a day .
so every morning i jum@@ ped to my w@@ lan@@ wa@@ age , and people are talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch for lunch , just a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
this is what the future might look like with changes with changes , the tree tree of evolution can be acceler@@ ated with syn@@ syn@@ tic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ a , and maybe eu@@ kar@@ kar@@ on@@ tes .
we all know that definition inter@@ media media by definition non@@ lin@@ ear , con@@ ves the reas@@ tivity of the lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what , of course , tells us that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity as normal today .
once the first is finished , when it wal@@ ks the way as promis@@ ed , it &apos;s all clear , because economic , the energy den@@ sity is so different from nuclear energy , as we know it .
now if you look at the extre@@ mes , the plans that ban@@ off@@ ered two fund had a tial rate in the &apos; 7@@ 0s were still not as high as we want .
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan win@@ ston , who at the time who was the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ at@@ u@@ re ##AT##-##AT## @@ designer , and it was called &quot; digital do@@ main . &quot;
and that question should ask that question of you , and every single day that you as@@ you something that needs to be done . if not now , when ? and not me , who then ?
when you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people were so tou@@ ched by this -- apart from the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ tas@@ story , why were you so so tou@@ ched by image world ?
of course , gest@@ ages con@@ y not only with the subject of per@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cognitive ser@@ gon@@ om@@ y , but pri@@ mar@@ , of course , with the theme of human -@@ obje@@ ctive relationship .
if you &apos;re more intui@@ tive , and i have to pun@@ ate my little friend here and look again , what does that mean from the perspective of cognitive cognitive gon@@ om@@ y , when is something something intui@@ tive ?
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted the concept of the arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was based based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
because of different success@@ es in the light sector through other au@@ tot@@ yp@@ es , through new metho@@ ds in houses , there are a lot of services whose energy effort some individual services services can reduce by 90 percent .
it was like if time was standing still and the dan@@ cer enter a kind of pri@@ form . he didn &apos;t do anything but he ever done before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything all bled together .
and when i say computer game , you &apos;re very likely to have mind that some people are pick people around front of any sol@@ es , or they &apos;re playing with some con@@ so@@ le in your hand .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i , like su@@ cking this stuff , this sub@@ stance you make from different species also con@@ tains metho@@ x@@ y@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ r@@ es of fish ev@@ rise -- bar@@ ash , sea water , sh@@ ri@@ mp , a@@ al -- and mi@@ gu@@ el and his company completely completely turned the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction .

i live a a living from building computers , and i know that i could the mechan@@ ism i &apos;m using to build computers without not making the recently progress in computer technology .
there &apos;s a research institution called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which is dealing with different techniques to del@@ ay global warming so that we could come for 20 or 30 years to get us together .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , you and i are developed like bo@@ ster rock@@ rock@@ ets to send the genetic question to the next stage of the orbit to then fall to the sea .
and maybe that change could also happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened do@@ ors ors me rather rather than meet people who wanted to nar@@ ke me , or wanted to give me an idea .
i go to my foot@@ age of these ic@@ e@@ mountains like like making portra@@ its of my ancestors , the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments moments this way , and never exi@@ that again .
that &apos;s to say , there could be something , on average , which is female female brains diff@@ different from males , which makes us attention to highly complex social relationships , and more attention to provi@@ ding the prote@@ ctive needs .
each of these techniques that i descri@@ to you today today inten@@ ded to help you manage manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people you offer the service .
now we can do it clo@@ sely . and course there are risks , but we can do something like tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help of people , millions of people people exten@@ tend their lives .
i don &apos;t remember remember the pir@@ ates that came from many times , but had from the death ty of the men on our boat , or the out@@ failure of the mot@@ or that didn &apos;t start six hours .

as we continue on and forward our science , we &apos;re increasingly increasingly into a zone of un@@ comfort where we need to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we had are probably too simple .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries built built it so so anyone who &apos;s imple@@ mented a fast re@@ actor , has a can@@ di@@ date date for our first .

i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically gr@@ zz@@ y sounds of me , hop@@ ing to create a similar conf@@ used idea in your head , , which has some simil@@ ar@@ ity to my original idea .
the con@@ sequence is that that someone like me actually has a brain that was more and@@ ro@@ ro@@ genes than a woman who born with te@@ sti@@ cles and had an and@@ ro@@ re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .

it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection , which i think is dri@@ ves us to be not just be open to all the bright bright and a@@ vid things , but for the dark and proble@@ matic .
so what they suddenly started understanding -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea how your brand is understood is a bro@@ ad problem .

now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m almost almost finished -- as a basic question , the thing to think about it , what that en@@ ables all this choice in the industri@@ alized societies is the material wealth .
remember that a large fra@@ ction of the americans who live under the poverty line have access access electricity , , water toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tion@@ ers and cars .

i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that i i hope are con@@ harmon@@ te with other things that you &apos;ve heard before , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if if you haven &apos;t noticed up .
and the exciting thing about this , if you look at this , this society , this computer@@ -@@ society , is re@@ je@@ cts a many of mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ical thinking patterns from the tri@@ b@@ al society .
so we have the concept that being a woman means to have a a female identity ; being a black is , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of own story .

but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in dre@@ ty team , and it job our is to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago , the so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called stra@@ jan@@ was found , and this was a tro@@ j@@ who was used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to p@@ p@@ te their own citizens .
so you can see how slowly this mechan@@ ism is resol@@ solving , and what the tra@@ ces that it behind that lead to something different than than this magni@@ cent picture of ourselves , i want to tell you another story .
and what we looked at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ off@@ ments that were possible to a a re@@ ment plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , affec@@ ts the prob@@ ability more being saved for tomorrow .
in terms of marriage marriage and family , there was a time when which the standard assu@@ mption that almost almost everyone had one , and they married married as quickly as they could , and then kids as quickly as they could .

today , in the world that we live in -- we weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as expected -- the best you can ever hope is that as good as you expect them .
it &apos;s as easier if you do it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ tes as we are it : you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out and you put another other in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about c@@ lon@@ ing .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would regi@@ sign up really legi@@ ti@@ mate scientific dou@@ dou@@ bt about the idea of -- basically -- fe@@ thers that are following people and apply spr@@ a@@ y to their projects and so on .
i have a check in my my po@@ cket , trained on the top organization of ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check at the level of 7@@ 100 100 to fund my ted as@@ mission in the next year .

b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens to the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and you pack it into the next re@@ actor , and you burn it on .
you see , when i was a kid and my father wi@@ ped me lying -- and he &apos;s sitting sitting there and looks at me this at at -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three ver@@ sions in every story .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now colle@@ cted by all from all -- from the entire collective memory of what , visu@@ ally the earth looks like -- and everything is connected to each other .
and if you say that these are the things that sure the future of good food , somebody stands up somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love p@@ fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how will you feed the world ?
ok , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re spending now playing now , that just makes sense when you think of the time in terms of terms of of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary extraordinary .

and yet , this terrible fa@@ te actually happens to somebody anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every every two weeks , an older ly dies dies and takes the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an old language to the gra@@ ve .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and they put it g@@ ently the top top they step a step back , and &quot; ta@@ da ! &quot; they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
and now we &apos;re getting to the next generation , and the exciting is , such a gener@@ ation shift is just a a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at this moment in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re doing something like that .
the only thing we knew was is very , very complicated in terms of the windows down part , the dro@@ p@@ per@@ - part , he made coun@@ coun@@ t@@ less zer@@ o@@ - -- h@@ sur@@ ts .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with with su@@ fi@@ tional technology , but i just cap@@ tured up , and surro@@ unded myself with amazing people , so we could put something together on the legs .
and the ko@@ hl@@ stri@@ es and oil du@@ stri@@ es have spent a quar@@ ter a billion dollars last last cal@@ dar@@ dar@@ year to pro@@ mote clean coal , which is already a con@@ tradi@@ ction in themselves .
and that &apos;s because right now , also the core core cause of the scene is to increase that avail@@ ability of technology , and also increase the information and the com@@ pre@@ hen@@ bility , so that more people can engage in there .
while they recogni@@ zed how to stre@@ tch out hands out and gra@@ b it , pick up the r@@ es and move it , they actually learned how to think and and solve problems by understanding understanding and change spa@@ tial inter@@ her@@ dness .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is just brie@@ measu@@ red , the animal king@@ dom , like a single act , and human human life , a small of of notes .
the other volunte@@ er who had just arrived front to me -- call him call le@@ x lu@@ ther -- first reach@@ ed the main man first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog dog of the house ow@@ ner@@ ship .
because that i can take the things things like the bits , tou@@ it , and they come up to me , is much more natural than if to make about hier@@ arch@@ ical web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms to somehow make these things available .
now if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , then would be on the se@@ mi@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale would come very ir@@ on@@ able , in the form of a flat line .
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that little teams that are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus focus can create extraordinary things , things that large companies and governments could create in the past .
the idea that i want to leave you with with is that we are on the th@@ ge to this new generation of value to interaction with digital media that bring information to our world that match our dem@@ ands .
or perspective , what you normally understand under a lab , these &apos;re kind of ri@@ ma@@ ed machines , extremely expensive , extremely const@@ ant , just for profession@@ profession@@ als , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with ph@@ .@@ d. , and so on .
take you look at the area of of the eastern pacific , western from the american continent and beyond the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dra@@ dec@@ line of oxygen in the oceans .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey ll where there have been asked than half a million people have been questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other eff@@ or@@ ts in the direction .

he jum@@ pped out outside , dro@@ pped his pants out of ab@@ alone fu@@ r and he de@@ at@@ ed it into his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started free@@ zing , he formed them into the shape of a kni@@ fe .

i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and back back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i thought it was important to do a work in aids organizations .

he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to all all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i read the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate je@@ ans i ever had .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program that , and accor@@ ingly , you ha@@ ck it , like that , and that &apos;s what i thought i was incredibly fascinating , and that &apos;s where i wanted to go in much deeper .
and he has such one , you know , this is such a brain wave device , like e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something like that , so he &apos;s been doing neuro@@ biology biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
it should be our goal that that if families think about where they want live and work , they give the opportunity to choose between at least one hand of full of different cities that are all in competition in competition for new dents .
so i gave another another sort -@@ facts talk that has put a graph graph like this that tries to to cate that if you want to create a lot value in a city it must be a very big city .

you then get to big amount of money , and this &apos;s where rational people can res@@ agree if you have got something that &apos;s not economic , and you try to fin@@ ance that , and for me here &apos;s the most waste .
the game game industry s con@@ sol@@ s that save energy , and work on mobile nets , rather than the broad@@ band internet , so players players around the world , especially india india , china , brazil online .
some of us may have decided for one of these mes , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te that is at the same time in both he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere .
and we know that at now just doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look 30 or 50 years at the future , because &apos;s going to be so different that a simple high ma@@ ding of what what we &apos;re doing right now simply &apos;t make sense sense .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and anno@@ ying : steve le@@ le@@ vi@@ tt told you yesterday about how these te@@ expensive and sever@@ to child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
okay ? there we were and f@@ ing through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i coo@@ ok and i swe@@ , i have ger@@ d to my k@@ ne@@ , and mi@@ gu@@ el is quie@@ quie@@ on a biology lec@@ ture .
but if we can able to get an effective windows virus is going to place on a laptop that &apos;s used by a waiting engineer to con@@ figu@@ re gra@@ y box , we &apos;re in the business .
so , first of all , if you enter one these online games , especially at the world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to trust them them a world &apos;s mission mission and inst@@ antly .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht somebody brea@@ ks together , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your micro@@ software cell phone to find the next a@@ ed ed who can save lives .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no in@@ ri@@ ants , he under@@ ves ves massive , , because the water that flo@@ ws through this farm comes coming out of of the river of gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
especially in today &apos;s world , at this inter@@ section of new and old media and the frag@@ ded media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting investi@@ ga@@ tive tool that the crow@@ ses get that message .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we also be a lot of hands ?
but actually , this note , for the things we do that don &apos;t completely lead to the big redu@@ ctions , just as , or even a less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for innovation for this break@@ through@@ s .
this is a state where the heart fa@@ ils , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood , part of the the blood blood comes up in the lung , and and fil@@ ls it gradu@@ ally , so the shor@@ th@@ mi@@ ty came .
before the background , i &apos;ve just bus@@ y at this , what does it mean actually , what &apos;s for natural for us , what have we have have lost , but what &apos;s also instin@@ c@@ ctive for us , , so what makes the difference ?
but if we &apos;re able to suppor@@ support the human mind to continue hope to find themselves and other people around around themselves beautiful , to be curious and fan@@ ci@@ asy , then we put our forces really positive .

after these expedi@@ tions , we started to ate what we had seen there really appreci@@ ate , , example , these deep sea sources , where we saw these incredibly incredibly amazing animals , these are sort of ali@@ ens , but here on earth .
we should not de@@ v@@ ct these challen@@ ging times or den@@ y , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid avoid them , or should we rever@@ se them under the car@@ pe@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ ali@@ zing opportunities in the me@@ oles@@ c@@ ts .
they use tools like the fe@@ fr@@ j@@ to to ci@@ pa@@ ate their computer with a tro@@ j@@ an that allows them to monit@@ monit@@ or their entire communication , to stop their online discus@@ sions , collect pas@@ s@@ words .

and what we &apos;ve done , for two thou@@ sand@@ th nine , the hall was finished , until two thousand thousand basically basically everything that was developed between the single system of electr@@ on@@ ics , software , we did .
and they would be so dee@@ pen@@ sed into the cu@@ be game , because games are so fascinating and giving us with satis@@ satis@@ fying , happ@@ , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , that they would forget there was nothing to eat .
there are oles@@ oles@@ ence and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just too real , and every person is different with it , but the question is not whether we ac@@ e with ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence or not , but how we deal with it .
we challenge teams teams around the world to connect all these technologies together together a mobile phone so so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equi@@ with ai , you can actually low in or test your blood values .
the model is already explo@@ ped in the wom@@ b , and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it works in young and old the world , and it &apos;s being used by us all the time without without most of them haven yet knew that this model was there .
but i have to understand at the heart , in beings , when information becomes information , when when become information from data and then information information information , so that i know how to also make things happen be intui@@ tive or or naturally course , after@@ wards .
and that said , with hon@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency &quot; &quot; was pres@@ ented by my good friends from em@@ c , who paid $ 7@@ 100 for the name rights on e@@ bay .
or you could close the building and and the whole architecture , like in this case you know , this days , if you drive down the roof , you &apos;ll get pictures of people who were there saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
and i also changed my thinking over the time , and if you had me at the age of 15 if i had swa@@ pped my pro@@ s@@ thes@@ tics against legs of meat and b@@ ones , then i wouldn &apos;t have del@@ ay ated a second .
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind , a mind that has broken broken &apos;t has any hope . he doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful . he l@@ ac@@ ks our natural , childhood curi@@ osity and our in@@ na@@ te capacity of imagination .
you invi@@ te d.@@ n@@ .@@ a to gold@@ particles particles and then the gold particles then then into this air pressure ting gun , and then i then sho@@ it them on oni@@ oni@@ ons , and then then brought them to light w it like this .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and this was , when we mis@@ the george washington bridge , pretty much much much of of hair -- i thought , man , there one thing i really re@@ gre@@ t .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct can see that these are a of different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything is in process , from the mobile y ##AT##-##AT## @@ camera to professional sl@@ rs , a fairly large number of them that have all been fli@@ ed ed together in this environment .
and shor@@ tly after that , janu@@ ary 19@@ th , at con@@ gress , con@@ gress a change in the const@@ it@@ ution to have a bro@@ ative policy that is reli@@ able to special developing areas .
and it &apos;s just been a up with software , but there &apos;s also in in the electr@@ on@@ ics area , there &apos;s also a whole tin@@ st@@ ler scene , which do it with electr@@ on@@ ics circu@@ its all kinds of de@@ gra@@ ding things .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow being driven in nature , determin@@ ed , by the larger pi@@ le that immediately attra@@ cts you , then you also quickly feel that there has to be such thing as free will .
now since the notes notes represents everything different than an accu@@ rate record of the cause of the com@@ pos@@ er , but only just a sc@@ aff@@ old , i now turn this sc@@ aff@@ old to fill it back with meaning and meaning .
so we actually created six months later created a reality where i found myself in a russi@@ an di@@ mer@@ boat , four kilometers below the surface surface of the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a book eye .
in my an@@ atom@@ ic lec@@ ture , i learned the orig@@ ins and run@@ ners of any muscle , every bran@@ ch of any ar@@ tery , which is away from the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses .
now , this is a trick that i often often teach little kids who are very interested in magic , because you can learn learn a lot about de@@ ception if you look more clo@@ sely , even though it &apos;s very simple ex@@ form trick .
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same engine of science that can en@@ able the changes to prevent disease , could also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ capacity ti@@ ten@@ capacity -- the better memory .
we put out six different different vor@@ s of mar@@ ade or 24 24 different fla@@ s of mar@@ mel@@ ade ade , and we looked at two things : first first , , which case , more people would stay alive and try mar@@ ands ?
and what you can do with it , and also go tar@@ ed to society with it and ask , , so , okay okay , what do you know , what do you want to do with you , you have an interest in bringing you into it ?
if i know something takes three seconds to get to to to , from the present into the past loo@@ p , i can also take very well war@@ waiting ings in which i always doing it with somebody at three seconds .
the film didn &apos;t bring any money , in fact , he was just just his production costs costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by magic that went out .
well , and i &apos;m now , on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ boat , and i see plan@@ ners that are similar these bra@@ kes here and and i know know once once the band once played there .
but what happens , almost always , happens is that the ta@@ -@@ da becomes becoming a &quot; u@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ oh , because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws causes the whole thing to ban and as@@ m .
in the view of the living itself , if you have a vac@@ ation and the second week is just as good as the first one , the two ##AT##-##AT## @@ week week vac@@ ation is twice twice as good as wee@@ k@@ ly vac@@ ation .
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ je@@ cted a medical treatment , because he had already treated with electro@@ sho@@ cks and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and trade models ves a trau@@ ma that followed him his entire life .
but one thing &apos;s going to happen . you think that you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because when you think it , you &apos;re remin@@ ded of how horri@@ ble the weather in o@@ hi@@ o was , and you &apos;ll feel that you feel you &apos;ve made the right decision .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a co@@ operation based based in india , but that now has members of members or active people all over the world .
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was three three months se@@ af@@ , she dem@@ ands all kinds of rights three months before h@@ ein@@ rich -- the right to have conven@@ i@@ ent sex , the right to choose , the right to drink .
we built a website website and we asked a crowd of crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please please tell us where he is , when he has , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed in business times .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of the city hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who saw that he could use this ap@@ p , not for the s@@ now , but so the citizens adop@@ t tsun@@ am@@ i si@@ r@@ es .
then it goes back to front , because the back doesn &apos;t looking at the front and says , &quot; let , look look at again , and assu@@ sure what what you see looking at is also what you want want to see .
many of you are fa@@ fa@@ thers who are forced to leave back families back to look for work , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clo@@ thing .
but the question is very simple , if if you make yourself completely independent of any fossil or pri@@ ani@@ energy energy rier that are dri@@ out somewhere in the world and are brought wn to them , they &apos;re actually an island .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the dig@@ ging between the long ##AT##-##AT## term and the shor@@ short term people will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich rural ths , and almost every lives of those two billion will that two billion going to be much much worse .
look at this interesting stati@@ stic that was recently published by resear@@ cher car@@ car@@ ne@@ gie ell@@ on university cher : the average young man of today in a country with strong play culture spend 10,000 hours with online games the 21@@ st life year .
this is the map of a little organis@@ m my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tal@@ ium , has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried whether to do this with an even smaller genome .

we work in a system where mistakes mistakes every day , where one of 10 medi@@ cations is either a a wrong se or do@@ do@@ zed , where hospital infe@@ ctions ctions become more and more rich and cause de@@ va@@ station or dead .
where i had had experienced most exc@@ it@@ ement ately , the south african african run@@ ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender was asked in the world cham@@ pi@@ ship in ber@@ lin .

if you get evil -- if you easily fall in hn@@ ven -- i introduced this to a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman has almost less powerful .
and if these tools become more physical and develop a awareness of their mov@@ ements , recognize other and percei@@ ve the ene@@ mi@@ es of our environment with them , then we can start to explore new new and entertain@@ ment interaction ways .
a lot of ancient societies , including the of gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ man , have really believed that the language language of a es@@ cape has a huge force , because what you say to l@@ oud can also mani@@ fest fest .
but as the already quot@@ quot@@ ed examples of the syn@@ ony@@ dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language gives us space space to imagine something that we all wish to wish : to allow each single individual to see themselves as a powerful people .
they thre@@ w sh@@ in@@ photos of themselves out of the air , which we would consider as friend@@ friend@@ gest@@ ure , and while they for@@ got that these people out out of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything dimensional in their life .
they left ly@@ di@@ en , and they went looking for for a new home , and they left left as many people back as there was food to survive , and looking for the rest of an area where they could thri@@ ve .
here &apos;s a fe@@ ding of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in in fact , we used he@@ f@@ ver mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces , we ted them . ye@@ ast then matically matically them together .
and in just like a a ce stage , na@@ na@@ than@@ iel when we started with our first lesson lesson lesson in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney ney ert conc@@ ert , and he had this ir@@ re fli@@ pp@@ ers in his eyes and started completely lost .
there was any law@@ yer or a asse@@ al head who could now tell people for the rest of his life , that he went to a burning house just just saving five seconds faster than me .
maybe you &apos;ve actually saved your people through play by by es@@ at@@ ter@@ ed into games games for 18 years and then having that intui@@ lation , and learned so much about play each other , that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
in one case , you may have somebody with a x@@ y chromo@@ base , and the s@@ ry gene gene of the y om@@ o@@ som@@ s blo@@ ps the proto@@ gon@@ ads that we have fe@@ tal stage , all grow to the te@@ stes .

they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and essi@@ g and over 500 different kinds fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually dr@@ un@@ ned ligh@@ tive water .

i want to say that that i probably also know some bright lab@@ ra@@ dor@@ or dogs who more capable to make more t@@ ser , more intelligent and ri@@ ma@@ er decisions about their sexual relationships than some 4@@ 0 ##AT##-##AT## @@ year ##AT##-##AT## old i know .
years ago , when i was doing a graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ care@@ vis@@ or@@ who asked me my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at myself as a min@@ ist , so do do it -- a really strange question .
and my nose used to be in a book , a science ce ##AT##-##AT## @@ fi@@ ction book that kid@@ na@@ formed my thoughts into other worl@@ ds , and in narra@@ tive , satis@@ fied my deep inside of , sitting ir@@ rel@@ aci@@ ti@@ ti@@ able curi@@ osity .
a few years ago ago i i went to the city i i grew up , to a food food market in that red red zone in the nor@@ the@@ ast ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ ania , and i was there before a eff@@ of to@@ ma@@ to .
the other hat p i &apos;ve car@@ ried in my work is one of the activ@@ ist , as a patient law@@ yer -- or , as i say , as an im@@ patient yer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
so these are the three major attac@@ tion groups : crimin@@ als who do it because of the money , ha@@ ck@@ sts like anony@@ mous , who afford it resi@@ stance , but the last group group nations nations governments governments who are the attac@@ ks .
and in this fol@@ der , there were notes notes of a ger@@ man company that had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government sold some programs where they could -- in a very large scale -- any communication of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
businesses businesses that are not worl@@ ds for themselves , businesses that re@@ re@@ store instead of using , businesses businesses that grow exten@@ sive rather than inten@@ se farmers farmers not only gener@@ , but experts for relationships .
because what turns out is , if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , in the form of an as@@ pir@@ p@@ let , that &apos;s just a round round , white p@@ ill that has a particular ur@@ able effect .
as i said , i &apos;ve been some some pretty terrible situations in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ myself , nothing could help me to go something as difficult and as dangerous as to go with these guys .
but that &apos;s the most thing that can happen , because this is the group comp@@ sion , group comp@@ comp@@ ci@@ on to help patients , because this could be be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could a@@ a@@ patients the smo@@ ke .
and so i get from the city a very different view , a very different impres@@ sion , which i see negative and positive ones of a city , and i get in this way , a a very different different , virtual map of a very real city .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new com@@ com@@ f , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you have to be gr@@ ate@@ ful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
when we get to these really big pieces ges -- with with over 100,000 base irs -- then they don &apos;t just grow up in e@@ . col@@ i . it tran@@ ce@@ ds all possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we turned going to to other mechanis@@ ms .
and dr. ke@@ an kept telling , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids if they weren &apos;t being anything all the time , and even if they only get a little bit of support if if you let kids to their yourself , then kids can do a lot . &quot;
something interesting interesting happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this movie -- and that is , we had to create kind of kind of liquid water water -- and we came back to computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
now let me introdu@@ ce you ele@@ gs being car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ a spin@@ al al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury years ago , which has the conclu@@ sion that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years and so now .
and i want to say something that is something radical to a fe@@ fe@@ min@@ , and that is that i think there might be different kinds of insi@@ ghts gover@@ gover@@ from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , in particular , especially when people to group thinking .
some bacteria have found how they can stay away pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve written this information with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin because the bacteria communicate to each other .
for example , take this child in bar@@ as@@ ana in the north west of the ama@@ zon , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da , believe that they came my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally the mil@@ ky river from the east the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
together , the coun@@ t@@ ous cultures in the world form a web of spi@@ ritual and cultural life that wra@@ unds the earth and which earth earth as important as the biological web that you know as bio@@ sphere .
but because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can dis@@ y it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and ach mes@@ sages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live .
we turned off the light , we put it in a vac@@ vac@@ u@@ um and we su@@ it all the air , and cool@@ ed it to almost the now , just in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the piece of metal was free to be@@ have like it wanted to to .
the coal co@@ evolution dri@@ the industrial revolution , and even even the the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid in electricity electricity sion , and that &apos;s why we have fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tion@@ ers , we can make modern materials , and do so many things .
in other services , like making ferti@@ li@@ z@@ z@@ , 10@@ 5 00 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- &amp; amp ; 00 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic or air traffic , the space for impro@@ vement is much smaller .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her brand brand person@@ ality kt@@ i had two separ@@ separate , but supp@@ ment@@ ative pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck@@ ck brand is an ei@@ th / connected brand .
not to burn the ligh@@ wa@@ ge dge a little bit better and re@@ lay it , and lose all all the materials materials for cy@@ cles , but first ask how do you close cy@@ cles ?
because the moment i i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from the back , this finger here , my ti@@ x finger , just from where it was , in a position where it &apos;s exten@@ out .
that is , i &apos;ve actually spo@@ sed them in the way now that no longer you see a pattern in it , but i &apos;ve condi@@ ted them in a a very period time time to see this dog dog in this spo@@ ven picture .
and then if i go one step further into these natural user inter@@ faces , where i have control voice voice by language , touch touch , gest@@ ure , no longer by the mouse and cur@@ sor , the things , i &apos;m even even faster and even immedi@@ ate .
and i left the medical study with the impres@@ sion that if i memor@@ memor@@ i@@ zed everything , and i knew everything , or at least much as possible , as close to comple@@ li@@ bility as i could , that i was imm@@ une to making of er@@ r@@ ors .
we see this here , when i turn things up , then i can design conf@@ using like like on the right , where i don &apos;t know know what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can make them so intui@@ tive by showing things .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing the bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years years , and that &apos;s what started started because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do myself , which i &apos;ve learned in theore@@ tically in study .
now when i look at all these people i realize that the majority of them are government offi@@ ci@@ als , and some come from science , some some , even less , come from the economy , and here my bo@@ ss , and one comes from the field of music .
we need solutions , either one or several that have uni@@ mag@@ ei@@ able sc@@ and in@@ mag@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and even though there are many direc@@ tions where people are looking for for it , i really only only see five five who can afford these big dem@@ ands .
that means you &apos;ve found yourself , by spo@@ about a common language , you could communicate with each other , you moved into the same ca@@ ve or into other areas , you formed cities or or villa@@ ges , and you created created the tri@@ b@@ al society to a sense .
if you allow someone to activ@@ ate their own intern@@ al al forces -- the human mind is so com@@ com@@ men@@ ve -- if you do that , and open open a door for somebody at a cru@@ cial moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
most women , just like me -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ chromo@@ som@@ es structure , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually respond on and@@ ro@@ gens .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a fol@@ k decision there &apos;s &apos;s in spring decision where it &apos;s about actually doing a effort effort to der@@ i@@ ve something of the money of that otherwise flow into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ .
i &apos;m a designer of the house , so of course , i work with the theme of curi@@ osity , and how does the curi@@ osity re@@ change our thinking , and why do we also lose curi@@ osity , and why we have to re@@ build it again and so on and so on .
they en@@ ables us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film that you use mr@@ i today to st@@ le the air centers of the brain , both make adverti@@ sing and films .
here &apos;s a photograph i recor@@ up at the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands when i went with in@@ u@@ its to the nar@@ wh@@ ale ja@@ unt d , and and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we come the paraly@@ sis make a decision , we end less happy with the result choice than we had the opportunity to choose less possibilities .
i don &apos;t have to stick these things emotion@@ ally because right right around the corner , there will always be another crazy , color@@ color@@ ful , stra@@ al out@@ fit fit that only wa@@ ited for me if i have a little love love in my heart and search it .
now , deci@@ ding &apos;t buy glass of mar@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least , it &apos;s good for our wa@@ al -- but it turns out that the decisi@@ over@@ la@@ pping problem also affect us also in very sequen@@ sequen@@ cing decisions .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t en@@ ab@@ science science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid is a real dead af@@ gas , and it kee@@ ps millions of people from fl@@ our@@ ishing .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regul@@ ated countries is high . the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go go wrong , despite the human contribu@@ tion , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- those who make mistakes and the who who don &apos;t , the ones who restri@@ cts lack of sleep and those without restri@@ ction , with bad out@@ comes , and good out@@ comes .
and we started making make pieces , starting with pieces , that con@@ tain five to seven seven thousand letters , assem@@ bled them together to make 24@@ ,@@ letter pieces to assem@@ ble together up to 7@@ 2,000 .
the last example that i have time for today to show it is a musical music cer cer for live u@@ c@@ ces that we &apos;ve recently developed and in si@@ ft@@ ables ables as sounds , like leadership , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
immediately after that choice , between the 21@@ 21@@ st and 24@@ th of febru@@ ary , a d@@ ele@@ gation travel@@ ed about 30 dog people ers ed to the two places the world who were most interested in getting into the business of the urban age .
and when is something intui@@ tive , of course , and how can i influence as a form on it , and just to design things so that they &apos;re be a user friend@@ , so possibly possibly intui@@ tive tive , because then they &apos;re fun fun and &apos;re easy to use .
but when i was phones to him , and i asked him why he was doing these interven@@ tions -- it were highly ris@@ ky sur@@ ations -- his answer was that in his country , these these children would be very bad treated , and he had to do it .
as@@ sum@@ ing you live in a particular area , and you have a belo@@ ved person clo@@ g@@ ged heart disease sel@@ s , and your hou@@ se@@ arian re@@ f@@ this to a a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance is in cular cular is at 200 .
both in my prof@@ ession at ro@@ bin hood and also in my side prof@@ ession as a volunte@@ er man , i &apos;m wit@@ ness of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness at a great scale , but i also see actions of char@@ love and mu@@ tation of individuals .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security in the past few months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to appear soon -- as the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ten@@ ing , highly expected expected success@@ or of my un@@ away success .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this high ##AT##-##AT## @@ technology technology that you &apos;re counter is that it &apos;s actually to brings you to the future , but in fact it &apos;s that the future is right us , in our arch@@ a@@ ical roots .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in ja@@ il , on ren@@ cy , or with with related trans@@ lation .
last year , i showed these two sli@@ sli@@ des to illu@@ strate strate that the arc@@ tic ice d@@ pole , which had close close to three million million years , had the size size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states has s@@ hr@@ k by 40 percent .
later a day , i went around on this site with mi@@ gu@@ el and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm farm i &apos;d ever been on , &quot; how do you succe@@ ed ? &quot;
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative worl@@ ds like the world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so so satis@@ fying to stand at any on the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory that we rather spend our time in these worl@@ ds .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come in to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . &apos;t give up up . &quot;
and i definitely know that for me to do -- in my situation -- would very very dangerous start sort of down@@ down this dark path of assu@@ pe@@ ture -- especially in the situation that i &apos;m in in my career now .
imagination is more better than knowledge , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close , a and give give the clu@@ cation , designers need to think differently to get to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you quite very much for your attention and please .
i &apos;ve always ready my syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ dic@@ tion@@ ary in writing , but i was done with working on the text , and and i noticed that i &apos;ve never pro@@ ved in my life what word word dis@@ ab@@ &quot; really means .
they picked up these photographs up off the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , and they nothing find , and they conclu@@ that these were the business business cards of the de@@ vil , and killed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries with the ar .
and then if i keep ad@@ a a bo@@ val val , all of a sudden we don &apos;t see one one unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , another circle .
don you you a afraid you will pur@@ follow this work for your life and never comes of it , and that you will die on a jun@@ res@@ tree of of sac@@ red dreams -- filled your mouth filled filled with the bit@@ ter as@@ hes of the failure ? &quot;
and i &apos;m just holding up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to more intui@@ tive , more more natural , more friend@@ ly , and you you have to look look , what &apos;s actually natural for us humans , what is us@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive ?
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think that many of us will turn into our best version , at any given time and are ready , and per@@ tra@@ c@@ ous try to solve the problem , as long as as it takes , try it again after the fail pos@@ ke .
but it would be worse if i wouldn &apos;t remember that over 20 20 20 years ago , when when i a teenager when i first told about it that i wanted to be a writer , was fac@@ ted with the same kind of an@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed response .

and that &apos;s where they &apos;re called off my general general doctor so that he can see where my weight problem is is , which is not just in the moment i need car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but a look at the past .
and i &apos;m myself today , much his vision of me as as a strong and powerful young girl has sha@@ ped my self ##AT##-##AT## @@ image , and so i could imagine seeing myself as a strong of naturally strong , powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic human .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made normal letters letters we we use to symbo@@ li@@ li@@ ze -- and i wrote my vis@@ it@@ card card on a piece of dna , and i pli@@ fied it 10 stero@@ 22 times .
they then gave students over a three ##AT##-##AT## @@ month month of time with a suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ce &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; and they were told they were young , that they were very smart , and after those three months they wrote a ses .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and spir@@ ing , and so stimul@@ fying , at the end we we are measu@@ red in our technology , not by the things that we develop , not in our intelle@@ ct and minds .
and the message is is , we need to pay to these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ , if we , in a sense , our goals 20 , 20 , 20 20 of goals , 20 , 30 30 , 30 and 30 percent , and so on , if on we we want to reach them .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is everything , from from top to bottom , from beginning beginning the end , is completely covered with br@@ ands -- from the cover spon@@ sor you &apos;ll see in the movie , this is the brand x .

that was worth worth clo@@ sing myself in the clean space in all this year , because , you check this , the difference difference of scale difference between a single single at@@ om and this piece of metal is about just like the difference between the metal and them .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found , something very basic : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information the cell is continu@@ on both both daughter cells .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on earth that we say , there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ far@@ ing , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natural sh pro@@ system system , and as they all called , allow our own ex@@ cre@@ ents go back .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we we sort of became aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , there &apos;re right here as a real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know know know the people who are always ch@@ at there and so on .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that becomes information information technology is huge on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ mo@@ ore ore &apos;s law , and and the price performance qu@@ o@@ ent dou@@ bled every 12 to 24 months .
so perhaps this technologi@@ cal change shows increasingly clearly than ever that there has always a different truth , which which is that every human being can give society something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our biggest plus .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , to let it happen happen slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in trying to let design engineers engineers dou@@ , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it .
this is a problem because global warming ris@@ up the fro@@ zen reason around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there are vast amo@@ unts of fro@@ zen carbon , which , when it sts up , from micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .

what if we could turn around this situation around and put the internet on its head so that instead of always going from one to to another , begin to go from many things to many things , and by dete@@ patterns patterns that otherwise otherwise rema@@ ined hidden hidden ?

so there are great price challenges here . there are challenges in trans@@ mission mission , if we say , for say that the source of energy is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk that energy is coming from anywhere else .
so , what does that mean if we look back at what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the &apos;s place of place in evolution , and above all how we predi@@ ahead to the next stage , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
i met these people from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology allows them to project a light to any surface , and then draw with a las@@ er ter on that regi@@ gover@@ ns the negative area .
in the rich world , in the top er billion , we could probably be stri@@ ments and use less , but on average , that number will go up every year , and by total , more than dou@@ year , the number of the services that are being provi@@ ed per person .

the idea is , again , is that that again we engage engage engage people to do something and to change the environment -- almost as what we call it bed@@ in cloud motion as you a c@@ un@@ or , but with a cloud .
and for me , the question is what are we going to do because our science makes advan@@ ces in the of an@@ atom@@ y that we can reach@@ to a point where we need to ad@@ mit that a democracy that is based on an@@ atom@@ y could fall apart ?
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe against the op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds . but what we most needed was hope , a intellectual ori@@ entation , the will@@ ness sometimes be hop@@ eless places and wit@@ ness . &quot;

i also think there are theor@@ ies that start to how everything started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story about this which is at this time , little oil dro@@ p@@ cks ak around , which ed different kinds of re@@ cep@@ pes for chemicals .
now in the world of sav@@ , i think think one of the best examples that have come to the market recently about how to best man@@ about choice , was something where david la@@ ib@@ son worked a very lot , it &apos;s a program off@@ at harvard .
and then there &apos;s a memory der self , and the memor@@ ing itself is the one that coun@@ ts and main@@ tain the the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one the doctor add@@ res@@ es by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel l@@ ately ? &quot;
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t only take control control control , be cap@@ tain on their own ship , but can also help us in health , the face of the challenges that are before us , and the explosion of health health , double double demand , and so on .
this is what he looks like he &apos;s looking a date , but what he &apos;s looking for for is somebody who fre@@ ases him up when he &apos;s in@@ in@@ stra@@ ined , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at brand@@ burn f@@ fighting when it &apos;s covered by a meter s@@ now .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could sele@@ the president the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that or i could vote choose that wish , which is , hal@@ ed energy ri@@ ce without co2 is found , i would take that wish .
but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , which is very simple , compared compared to ours , trust me , which is simple simple , but if we all look at all these genes that we can elimin@@ ate one after another , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
we followed the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations back , and we found cases of a natural death , and when we asked people with prin@@ pressure something about it , they ad@@ ed that one of the people had become so old that he died died because his al@@ age , and we still killed him with the spe@@ ar .
so the ted@@ talk was in a very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place whose beginning is un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited country , a fo@@ unding contra@@ ct that determin@@ es the laws that are rule there and off@@ ers people the ability to decide either to live under these rules or not .
now these older people now come to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they talk , they &apos;re giving talks . they tell people they need should stop saying that for the first to do with terror@@ first in the history of our nation with terror@@ ism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and in this song , we &apos;re going to discover the possibility to be what we are : people who with full consciousness who are aware of the importance that all humans and gar@@ gar@@ dens must to be fac@@ fac@@ ded to thri@@ ve , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
so what you got was this you name pres@@ ented here : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea what the the theme will be , and who could could ever fly you content content eventually fly around your e@@ ars , especially if i let your company stand stupid for your participa@@ tion .
there are some pilot ot@@ projects that do this at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s it to 100 percent is will be very difficult , and to get an agre@@ ement for over@@ stor@@ the co2 co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the war@@ age question .
we &apos;ve working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the Ã©@@ toi@@ at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ theater in new york and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ il@@ and -- we took his mov@@ ements in 3d to use it as a impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in plac@@ e@@ bo effect , it might seem strange strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested in it it &apos;s , you look at it as i , as &quot; a illusion that becomes something real if somebody only belie@@ in enough . &quot;
people in the back , or the ones who later see this once on the video will say , &quot; well yeah , that looks quite impres@@ impres@@ sive , but but if it was real , it would be -- you see , here &apos;s a hole , and if it was really real , it would flo@@ wer . &quot;
as a result of that , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable one to schizophren@@ ic st@@ ases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it disappe@@ ars for days , travel@@ ing around the streets streets sk@@ sk@@ id row , always to this hor@@ ror and the tor@@ ture als of his own mind .
so if you look at google glas@@ ses , for example , then &apos;s such a concept of what lets us re@@ bine the virtual world with the real world , which is that our aff@@ in@@ ity of virtu@@ alization , feel the virtual as something natural is spo@@ talked again .
we now know that gender is complicated enough enough that we need to ad@@ mit that nature doesn &apos;t &apos;t draw that line between male and female female , or between male and inter@@ sexual and female and inter@@ ality , are we that pre@@ that line as of course .
and they &apos;ll become heal@@ thi@@ er by the use the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re being better trained by the k@@ han@@ -@@ acade@@ my mic , and by making they will have the opportunity to use 3d prin@@ ter and &quot; infin@@ ite computing , &quot; and be so much more productive productive than ever before .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as example , in iran , for example , where a man who sex@@ ually dra@@ wn to other men , is pun@@ ished with death , unless he &apos;s willing to supp@@ fer sex transformation in which case can stay alive .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and that they wel@@ come them , and they actually transform them for themselves themselves into something positive , and this is a story ess move .
and perhaps a little gli@@ gli@@ mp@@ se of what might be happening in a few decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore something or or to do other things in all sorts of post ##AT##-##AT## @@ human@@ human@@ arian future scen@@ ari@@ os that i can imagine as a sci@@ ce ##AT##-##AT## @@ fi@@ ction fan .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve done a few years years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which was clearly clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;d ever had had , and i think quite often times in relation to how often i think other vac@@ ation .
the reason for this is , if i draw it to a normal cur@@ ve , where let &apos;s say this this are the years , which is the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a kind , and this is a popular degree of technology technology that i want to do with a graph , the graph becomes al@@ sil@@ ly .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the rich@@ of ide@@ , that you bring new elements into play with -- like the te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how the game requires trust and pro@@ mot@@ ing -- at the same time it making tremendous fun .
i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man e@@ i kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang , in which we looked at the decisions of sav@@ ings for r@@ re@@ of almost a million americans of about 6@@ 50 places in the united states .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom tom was the em@@ bo@@ ment of the embar@@ ras@@ modern modern artist who tried to domin@@ ate these un@@ controll@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that lived in him and to get it with them .
by playing music music and talking about music , from from par@@ par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used man who had just moved through the streets streets of los angeles , a lo@@ vely , educ@@ , , , , , trained musi@@ cian in ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard .
the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy enjoy looking at these huge shel@@ ves of may@@ on@@ a@@ a@@ ise , star@@ f , essi@@ g mar@@ mel@@ ade , but we can &apos;t actually actually pull the compar@@ is@@ ons and boundar@@ ies , and then then can actually choose something of the fantastic offer .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely designed to figure out how to be prote@@ cted from the state , it &apos;s possible that if if we brought more mothers to go into this concept , we would get more of a concept , not just how prote@@ protect , but how to supply for each other .
you can think of this cultural life web as a eth@@ no@@ sphere , eth@@ no@@ sphere can defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ tions and intui@@ tions that have been produced by the human imagination , consciousness since the beginn@@ ings of consciousness .
now , i may be a little extremely extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have on on ce@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you make more more of it there &apos;s a real question . why do we give ies so much weight in the course of the weight that we give to experience ?
the leaders of the government in hon@@ dur@@ as would be pro@@ ted to aid of partner@@ countries , they could benefit from their partner@@ countries that would help you in hi@@ ing the laws for char@@ char@@ ter and everybody can trust that the char@@ ter is really imple@@ mented .
the next few weeks , i made designs , and i for the first time myself the un@@ healthy healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone alone , isol@@ ated , not the healthy ame you feel because you can &apos;t talk to colleagues about it .
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house while she was tra@@ cked by this po@@ em , it was only only that she had to get fast enough a piece of paper and a pen cil so that she could if it if it it it through her , capture and hold it on the she@@ f .
this curi@@ osity turns out that that always , when i wasn not in school , i would stre@@ ed across the fore@@ sts , walked , walked &quot; &quot; sam@@ ples , &quot; i brought fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and be@@ et@@ les and pon@@ ds , brought everything home and under the microscop@@ e .
in fact , i &apos;ve ex@@ myself most most of my career to the vo@@ of terrible situations , and all of of this just for trying to investi@@ study social issues so so that they &apos;re eng@@ aging aging and interesting interesting , and hopefully in in a kind of understanding that makes them for the audience and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
but since there only a company , an agen@@ cy was ready to help us and that &apos;s just just because i know john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree years years years -- realized that i had to do it alone , i had to avoid the middle man straight to my team to the companies .
another example : a couple of years ago , i got the call of a 19 year ##AT##-##AT## old man who was born as a boy , when boy raised raised , he had a friend , had sex with his gir@@ friend , living as man , and he had just found that he had o@@ var@@ gs and u@@ ter@@ us .
he dro@@ ve at high speed when he suddenly suddenly ars a little frag@@ of a mel@@ o@@ dy that , as it is often in inspiration inspiration often is is ag@@ oni@@ zing difficult to for him , and he wants to have them . she &apos;s gor@@ gor@@ ous . he s@@ ks ks for it , but he can &apos;t touch her .
these is this has a more arti@@ stic institution , so there &apos;s a lot of of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and in working with scientists , bus@@ y just to come up with these technologies and ask questions and to process that crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and yes , kinds of things .
now , not exactly what i &apos;d hop@@ to do , but i was going on -- up sta@@ ir@@ irs , down the hall@@ way , on the &quot; real &quot; fire@@ men men , who were pretty much finished with the ele@@ ele@@ ele@@ at this point , into the bedro@@ om to get a few shoes .
with the total transpar@@ ency of what the new thinking is what ban@@ gs on the old thinking thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the las@@ ag@@ ne &apos;s hor@@ horse meat and there &apos;s a bee@@ f anymore or other phenomen@@ a , i want to sc@@ p this and i want to do that .
in my about 20 years of medical sen@@ unding awareness and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical mistakes and wrong treat@@ ments to learn everything i could for for one of my first article i wrote for tor@@ onto star show show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and where you see how far we &apos;re gone away what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad we are that we &apos;re at earth on earth , can you see that , for example , open@@ b@@ ach has a program , up to 20 40 ters , you want to be here cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , yeah ?
these may be a modern contribu@@ tion , and if they do better than i would expect , that would be great , but my core stat@@ ement here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up none of them because they sh@@ mi@@ us us , because all have significant problems .
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and she ran and she ran , but didn &apos;t reach the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed through her , and she fit@@ sed it . she said it would go on over land and -- as she said , look for a different po@@ et .
up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , ti@@ me@@ ine , ad@@ vent@@ ous , extin@@ pped and lo@@ ved like er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , agi@@ le and le , professional , wonderful , magic and my@@ stic like gand@@ al@@ f .

and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , but it can also be be a access problem , which things simpli@@ simpli@@ fy things , any question question up , and how can you do it differently , or how can you do it better ?
and they simul@@ ated the wind sun and the load , and came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting result that you get out towards the conven@@ tional system , which after 20 20 years , needs a middle ra@@ ri@@ w about 5@@ 50 cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ hour , comes out about four and 40 cents .
and one day he watched me at one of my practic@@ cis@@ -- these practic@@ es were just ti@@ mili@@ ring and g@@ na@@ den@@ less -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , one day you &apos;re going to te@@ ar down one of these b@@ ands .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it it more and more that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ row , and rid of the the important significant quali@@ like possibilities , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sal@@ es es , it it &apos;s reduce the cost cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an impro@@ vement in decisi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ making .
a continent is always left left , because the con@@ guess was that there was no religious faith in sub ##AT##-##AT## @@ sahar@@ africa , and of course there was , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is just the rema@@ la of these very profound religious thoughts that came back during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very .

they consu@@ me the stol@@ sive co2 , which leads to temperature temperature incre@@ increasing , and this temperature incre@@ ases has has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rec@@ rect result , that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ada@@ pt to such ra@@ pid , and therefore whole systems fall together .
because we have this self ##AT##-##AT## @@ de@@ ception , that sense of being great , is caused from the highest beings , not from such kind kind of course , of such something un@@ predic@@ table able as an organis@@ m that exists exists exists to a rock and or whatever things , that that &apos;s sustainable for us .
and that &apos;s then , if you enjoy all your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke in the work@@ force and all the other things that we that we really really excited about , is government , at the core , in the words of tim &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we we do in common that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book recently -- a bi@@ ogra@@ ograph@@ y called &quot; eat eat , pra@@ y love love -- &quot; which , choo@@ cally unlike all my previous books for for some reasons , went out to the world and became a me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international best@@ s@@ eller thing .
but the process and the sever@@ e sti@@ b that surro@@ unds him him was li@@ f@@ ted when he took the geni@@ us out of himself , where he didn &apos;t as a a trouble , and left him to where he sort came from . he realized that it was not an intern@@ alized , oni@@ zing thing .
but in fact , you &apos;d been thinking about about it , but you could never reas@@ reas@@ on@@ able if it going to work , but since there are modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it and see see that , yes yeah ! with the right approach of the right ali@@ alist , it looks like that it worked .
but there were 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to get to this control , who wanted to do business business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful ful as me , and who eventually em@@ powered us tell stories stories we couldn &apos;t tell -- stories that a commercial would usually support .
and our goal was was , we wanted to get to seven to nine 50 percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then here &apos;s still this rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ w@@ able , which will be very , very expensive , and that won &apos;t work that you do that from bat@@ ter@@ ies .
this may be a little bit diver@@ gent first first so so repe@@ repe@@ it so it can work : if we want problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global confli@@ cts and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we we need to try to play games online for least 21 billion hours a week to at the end of the next decade .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that mi@@ mic the problem of decisi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ making -- -- stra@@ ct -- will get rid of the over@@ so@@ le@@ te alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real real ; categ@@ ori@@ ori@@ ze -- we can better deal with more categ@@ ories , less possibilities ; pre@@ p@@ for complexity .
in our desire to protect the people people we care most about about and and give them the cold , hard truth about their medical for@@ ec@@ ast , or even make a proje@@ ction for quality of life that you expect , we pay attention that we we don &apos;t make the ground to actually dis@@ led .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything everything changed . we had this big idea . and that big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual the the center the universe -- about all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies . and there &apos;s no room room for my@@ stic creatures that are missing from di@@ v@@ ine .
and what we were doing was actually to use a then new new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone -- and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ ted information from this network colle@@ colle@@ cted from oper@@ ators to understand how the city works .
but we don &apos;t even taste when we hear somebody say something like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of stat@@ ements for so long time , somehow we &apos;ve in@@ intern@@ alized the notion and and colle@@ c@@ tively accep@@ ted that creativity and suffering are of bel@@ ong , of course and that art at the end end always always always leads to the sou@@ l ag@@ nel .
i wanted to return to the r@@ out@@ ine and conven@@ i@@ ence of the life of un@@ known pre@@ ur@@ or -- a grandmother , a mother two dau@@ gh@@ ters who had cked ded each of her days as they did for 20 years , telling telling each other stories of their day and and as@@ le@@ ing , , three of us still in the same bed .
every time we think of na@@ tive and landscape , we either either ther r@@ ous@@ se@@ se@@ au and the old frame@@ work of the no@@ ble wild her@@ ds , which in in simpli@@ fication is a ra@@ c@@ stic thought , or th@@ th@@ ore@@ au and say these people connected to nature than us .
he spoke in a very sensitive and dig@@ dig@@ t@@ one about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , and about how the do@@ d@@ gers would never do to the baseball world series , and all this because of the dan@@ ful pas@@ sage of the first vi@@ o@@ in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
it would be great if we could exchange this paradig@@ m of normal@@ ity against a different possibility or the strength to even late it a little bit more more dangerous to exchange it , so so we could un@@ ase the forces of very many children , and invi@@ te them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
that &apos;s if you focus a las@@ er be@@ am , on one in the room , then you can capture in little little particles in the air or or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so then it &apos;s caught there , such like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am in principle .
i then tried this in my lab at home to ex@@ tend a little bit , and then bought bought secon@@ secon@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ hand equipment on e@@ bay , and did a little bit of n@@ a analysis , tried to do a father test , like this / d.@@ .@@ a finger@@ prin@@ prin@@ , go home again .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who who have sym@@ pathy for the hard situation of the in@@ tive tive , think of them as or@@ g@@ ini@@ al and color@@ ful ful , but somehow restri@@ ct them to the past , while the real world , is our world , continu@@ es .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ der@@ man , could tell you much more about percei@@ ving and the many other other wonderful things that you can do with percei@@ vation , but i &apos;d like like to to talk to the second piece that that we discus@@ at beginning beginning and that &apos;s the rise of our environment .

and if you were to different vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about how you choose conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think in terms of time you get an answer , and if you think in terms of memory ies you could get a different answer .

i think a significant significant -- not the only one , but a significant , the mis@@ sion@@ to to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide is that people have learned who are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain to these experiences themselves , you think it would be your fau@@ lt .

if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ and i spli@@ them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i show 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , and i divi@@ t them into 20 categ@@ ories , then &apos;ll think that i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better choice experience than i had given given the 400 400 to that if had given given you 600 .
it really works , and is done in the acade@@ mic setting , and we &apos;ve thought , o@@ o@@ k , this is what we get do there , then took a web@@ c@@ am , scre@@ scre@@ wed it up , took the l@@ ens off turned turned around , then you have a microscop@@ e that aug@@ aled up about four hundred a times .

i mean , most most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve calcul@@ ec@@ ated ated that -- you know , the psych@@ ological present is than about three seconds long . which means , you know , there are about 600 million them in a life , and in in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any tra@@ ce .

and then just came from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o or@@ g , the fo@@ under , , and said o@@ .@@ k , we really need to really meet ourselves now , also meet real , and then then organized zed two events , one in london , two two thousand 10 , and right back to the u.@@ .@@ a , in san francisco .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a that i &apos;ve met about a while ago , who have been that this is a student group that would like to to vey the public public more , what they &apos;re learning in college , and they they &apos;ve done little actions on the street ad@@ ands and and trying to explain what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
i read this list to a friend , and i had to lau@@ gh first , it worked so ridi@@ cul@@ , but i only came up to &quot; focused court &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk anymore , and had to stop reading and first colle@@ cting after this acci@@ scen@@ dent word flo@@ de and the connected emotional sho@@ ck .

so we have a situation like , where the further our science gr@@ ed , we need to ad@@ mit the more to ad@@ mit that these categ@@ ories that we thought were were stable an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which made very simple simple arr@@ ange@@ ments to create perman@@ ent identity categ@@ ories are much more smar@@ ter than we adop@@ ted .
