and he says ... and let and to to and he &apos;s and to &apos;s going to and and to to and he &apos;s going and to &apos;s and he says ...
thank you .
we were very poor .
se@@ attle ...
music as a language .
interesting .
after a week .
twice .
innovation .
wrong .
we know that .
ta@@ -@@ da !
less .
solar technology is ...
so what does that mean ?
sing@@ ing .
oh my god .
yeah , hell@@ o .
so what does that mean ?
home ?
i can help .
we &apos;re going to pick it up .
a lot .
does that sound good ?
but it goes .
i don &apos;t know about it .
i don &apos;t know about it .
we love entertain@@ ment .
doesn &apos;t happen .
we lose them .
oh my god !
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
thank you . thank you .
three out of 10 .
the only opportunity .
this was un@@ belie@@ vable .
long long , yeah .
ste@@ phen wat@@ ts .
the sun ris@@ es .
fantastic , right ?
yeah , so of speak .
thank you .
no hospital either .
them .
what a fish is .
that &apos;s actually me .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
wonderful ?
and she did .
they &apos;re all important .
in@@ efficient .
efficient .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
essential .
very different term .
so al .
exciting .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
what did ?
ban is blan@@ k .
i was ama@@ zed .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
pretty good , right ?
a few more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he op@@ ens up the door .
so they knew everything .
1,000 , very good .
good work !
that &apos;s great important .
the farm is un@@ belie@@ vable .
that was fascinating .
that &apos;s what you do .
so what do you say ?
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
what happened here ?
thank you .
sounds familiar ?
why no longer live ?
they have similar principles .
oh , that one .
hey , why not ?
that &apos;s our present .
this is the system of system .
see manhattan .
this was the result .
there &apos;s no normal in there .
centers built .
just do your job .
i &apos;m all interested in .
what happened here ?
len@@ to , slowly .
yeah , good good after@@ noon .
yeah , good good after@@ noon .
and that &apos;s important .
can i be honest ?
but what ?
it has sensor@@ s .
we can .
what was the result ?
here &apos;s video .
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
but what ?
again .
very good .
all of the environmental debate .
these people make money .
yeah , i know .
i don &apos;t know .
they use hands .
why do we do that ?
flying c@@ at .
and it needs back .
it &apos;s not a country .
that wish .
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i have a question .
how do we know ?
and i was an artist .
you know what ?
yeah , that goes .
we can do it differently .
so how does this work ?
let &apos;s call it don .
you care .
what do these people need ?
can we change it ?
these days are over .
b@@ g : thank you .
not school management .
this is the last one .
you can go inside .
so true .
so where do we go ?
that would have been .
i was thinking about it .
what is media ?
so let &apos;s see .
so here &apos;s an example .
so they can do that .
you . &quot;
i was fac@@ ed with him .
players are not sitting around .
and i continu@@ ed to work .
okay . thank you very much .
this is what happens to us today .
so she was back .
oh . a moment .
what do you want to do ?
to tell you .
or bom@@ bs .
.
we need energy wonder .
why does this happen ?
i go in here .
there are two op@@ tions .
but i continu@@ ed to work .
not tox@@ ic in it .
see it immediately .
why should we do that ?
he &apos;s not going to do that .
it feels great .
i wonder .
thank you .
they even hurt .
i swe@@ ar .
i represent kids .
and i understand .
i &apos;m a writer .
it &apos;s justice .
j@@ k both .
first of all , limited .
maybe 10 times .
be a ment@@ or .
put the camera out .
my gut sen@@ sation again .
but wrong things .
thank you .
after just one journey there .
yeah . all right .
not sad ?
so here you see it now .
challenge .
the data came in .
what creates illusion ?
and so it was .
one .
so here &apos;s another example .
but it didn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no food .
people were playing crazy .
but worse .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
he really enjo@@ yed it .
anybody seeing something ?
he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
good after@@ noon , all together .
and then international .
let me wra@@ p it up .
there &apos;s an old study .
there are online crimin@@ als .
he always showed here .
that great question .
some have come and went .
and that &apos;s amazing .
there were re@@ mix .
this is the city .
it was different in china .
here &apos;s another example .
i agree with you .
d@@ k : it &apos;s 6@@ 0,000 .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , not , yes ?
that great question .
and then again .
it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s not .
i &apos;ll never forget .
is it photograph@@ y ?
okay , more .
i mean sou@@ l .
but there &apos;s something else .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
very expensive real e@@ state .
yeah , here it is .
the answer is no .
and it got even better .
just further . a lot of fun .
crisis . death . cat@@ astrop@@ he .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
they did it secre@@ tly .
we lost touch .
it would be in@@ toler@@ able .
he had the experience .
and why ?
you hi@@ re compar@@ is@@ ons .
a almost iden@@ tical structure .
and i always had .
give give give pe@@ e a chance .
we have three main groups .
i felt really good .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
saw these guys ?
i don &apos;t think , rather , that .
what would everything have to be done ?
still fish .
and many people forget this .
it has billions of .
will i like the color ?
my name is am@@ it .
priv@@ acy must be given .
o@@ oh , thank you .
is that your opini@@ on ?
who will en@@ sure it ?
he &apos;s paul off@@ it .
they look like this .
don &apos;t be dis@@ coura@@ ged .
this is the short term .
the work of the interpre@@ ted .
that &apos;s not true of the emotions .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
where are useful ?
so what does that mean ?
also call it don .
they had mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we actually work ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened that ?
i grew up in india .
but what do your fish eat ?
and lu@@ ck@@ ily he did not die .
the game is 2007 .
i had good life .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i don &apos;t like that question .
so what do you think happened ?
that &apos;s .
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
what does that mean ?
is it about the light ?
... inv@@ enting his own story .
stop that .
first , we have the population .
you can see the water coming .
who are these rela@@ tives ?
i want to ask you something .
we have to spread the message .
you can see this down there .
you also have to understand that .
why not think about it that way ?
what am i ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we love technology and technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
his name is speed .
but what are we going to do with this ?
is it going to have my size ?
that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re always bu@@ ding all the time .
that sounds crazy , right ?
most of you know that .
i actually made two mistakes .
and this op@@ ens up a map .
it would be knowing .
so what do we need to do ?
fe@@ li@@ x .
conflict is creativity .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or is it possible ?
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
so we &apos;re too many .
maybe that &apos;s reality .
we were tens of people .
it sounds evil .
you can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
now , &apos;m going to end with it .
this is what the ch@@ art looked like .
what else can we do ?
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
they called me .
technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are coming .
what &apos;s the sou@@ l ?
i can say everything .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
that &apos;s the exciting .
but the key thing is ...
fit@@ ness ?
so it works like this .
and then they set them up .
and that &apos;s nothing .
what actually happened ?
one place is south korea .
i don &apos;t have to worry about !
they really loved it .
same thing only bigger .
well , i was the next one .
almost nothing left .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
again , you have it again .
so ha@@ why now ?
and finally , meaning .
this picture is from this place .
this was the beginning of journey .
first exten@@ sion , second .
you want to feed the world ?
connected those two people .
my wife told me .
but very sad .
what is this ?
they could have done better .
and is cru@@ x .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
very ris@@ ky .
is curious ?
and how did that feel ?
and it worked very well .
because you can train .
the answer is yes . &quot;
i suppor@@ ted them .
sometimes i push too much .
and then down .
i &apos;m in a@@ we .
her mother was thro@@ ding her alone .
so , you know .
who &apos;s most successful ?
tell me about this world .
i see this pl@@ us@@ sign .
and here &apos;s surprise .
this is natural thing .
thank you very much for your attention .
this was christ@@ mas .
okay , there &apos;s a couple of things .
they saw the big impact .
and it took 18 months to do it .
think about your own decisions .
so it &apos;s circle .
i just loved two .
she shares her experiences with others .
well , then we want .
there &apos;s no problem at all .
i may not be able to say that .
and the answer is , &quot; no . &quot;
it was a huge success .
&quot; yes , he said .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
is that reas@@ on@@ able ?
the data was not available before .
how many people choose creativity ?
pattern recogni@@ tion should still work .
it was my first sun@@ burn .
and there are hundreds .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
you can have this cloud .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
the power plant can explo@@ de .
it &apos;s all important op@@ tions . &quot;
made me sad .
they always say , why ?
what happened that day ?
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
people were still happy .
so let me remember .
they come from artists .
she was back and die .
now , how could this happen ?
now a third sentence .
but that &apos;s fast .
this is a game for the outside .
i learned everything memor@@ i@@ zed .
anyone know what that is ?
he showed him ja@@ four .
for example , that perception in context .
so that &apos;s good news .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
talk about water wars .
she did for three years .
it &apos;s another term .
it was just not invented yet .
sometimes perspective is the illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so they saw something ma@@ gical .
play is not sil@@ ly .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
he actually colle@@ cted fish .
no has never been a possibility .
so , we can do that too .
how can we help you ?
is this all just education ?
they changed the story .
and there &apos;s news .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the story isn &apos;t over yet .
but there are two problems .
and it was an incredible experience .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
nobody has ever said this before .
the whole building was water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today 2.@@ 3 million .
what should our te@@ stim@@ ony look like ?
but you know what ?
you can play with a different ways .
they create an epi@@ c story .
everybody needs a gold glass .
they basically do the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other br@@ ands act like this ?
the white lines are for the population .
play doesn not just child games .
and then we did .
and that &apos;s what he actually says it like this .
and then something happened .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly talks .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
that &apos;s a volu@@ me .
i talk a lot about these questions .
now , this was gran@@ di@@ os .
the data all the time .
and that &apos;s what we do .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
and this was 19 years ago .
doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
let &apos;s be nas@@ i . &quot;
it &apos;s , very simple .
so paul is a terror@@ ist terror@@ ist .
which one would like the most ?
right now , the waste is .
it doesn &apos;t have this sou@@ l .
i almost almost never co@@ ok with it .
in the morning , in front of the game .
i started feeling better .
an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
so this is one of the pain@@ t@@ ings .
we went to an area .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation again .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
it just doesn &apos;t cal .
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
this is about five meters long .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
and then to realize it .
there shouldn not suff@@ er other things below it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem already .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
so the question is : how ?
what lessons learned ?
once we started a alive .
and she &apos;s be@@ ating a 25@@ 7 .
they &apos;re going to of computers .
because does anybody got mas@@ ers here ?
waste is nutri@@ ent .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we all love baseball , right ?
and we &apos;re too many .
this has the impact .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
and shape matters .
slowly but i &apos;m sure it was going on .
you store energy .
then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing .
far@@ ther than that , we don &apos;t go .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been been a problem at all .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
okay , that really coura@@ ge .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
this is all meta@@ data .
and it starts with a doctor &apos;s doctor .
it gets more and more like you .
i &apos;m going to conf@@ ess something to you .
because i can say everything .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t .
the nur@@ se asked .
the creativity had to get out of it out .
everything is easy to have .
it sounds fri@@ gh@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
i really wanted to be normal back then .
i got a little sc@@ ared of technology .
so i went to the court .
once the ju@@ dge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so this &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
a very exciting phenomenon as well .
next nuclear energy .
let &apos;s quie@@ t .
but actually and effective , right ?
this is completely tri@@ vi@@ al .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
now i tried something exciting .
we smaller brand .
just be who you are .
her family gather@@ ed .
i remember my first fire .
but we need to all of that .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , right ?
what &apos;s a story ?
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
the reason write it .
i &apos;m sho@@ ot through my head .
so what happens .
not to navi@@ gate .
why did i go to medicine ?
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
all adults were aware of the risks .
have you vy ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
so the cor@@ relation .
the truth is more like this .
the game starts -- sil@@ ence .
do you want je@@ ans with holes ?
this is like speaking learning .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
so i just started playing .
this is how you can do something out of nothing .
but it &apos;s not being docum@@ ented .
so you can &apos;t solve .
and video is real time .
i like things different .
and that &apos;s very beginning .
so the dynamic has really changed .
i went to ja@@ il -- hard .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
because for me it means memory .
it didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
and i &apos;ve never .
and we said , okay .
it spre@@ ads rapi@@ dly .
how and what did he feel ?
it can know where we are .
this is a child game , right ?
we say sustain@@ ability in germany in germany .
and you know what i learned ?
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
this is a picture of the object .
you know , what &apos;s en@@ l@@ to is ?
a pretty crazy idea .
you see something fun .
anyone know what three seconds ?
that has to be the difference .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
you can show i was there .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
and a very simple question .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
i think it &apos;s v@@ gu@@ ous .
do we really want to go in this direction ?
they had been gene@@ gene@@ tically pres@@ sed .
music is medicine . music changes us .
he can only use his eyes .
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
i could draw . i could paint .
so the first step is an interpretation .
something was impro@@ ed in me .
oh , my time is over ?
baseball is great statistics .
this image remin@@ ded me of something .
i &apos;m the re@@ defined doctor .
priv@@ acy is not debate .
because we live on a water planet .
but another reason .
i really like beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
and there are reasons for this .
le@@ go made it possible for all of them .
we started 15 years ago .
we can re@@ gain our nutri@@ ents back .
assu@@ mption of maybe two percent .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
it turns out to be really hard .
how far do you get there ?
and these are neu@@ ral structures .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
anyway , we need a solution .
if you get that , right ?
you can do this all the time .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
so we &apos;ve measu@@ red its movement .
and that can make a big difference .
but the truth is far away from it .
it was quite popular .
the book and the picture .
sun@@ light and co2 are a techni@@ que .
so i stop , thank you .
that &apos;s the minim@@ um .
it has nothing to do with science .
they f@@ loo@@ ed the chan@@ n@@ els .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
but maybe this is not the case .
five million people every month .
but it takes a lot of a lot of planning .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in kids .
then we get this positive feedback .
for a year we had a cent .
now we do air@@ planes .
okay , you really want to know ?
now i see gre@@ g le@@ mond .
i fell in love with this fish .
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been too simple .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
i want to prove this to you .
this is where he lets the sun go up .
who would ever wish ?
and every morning i jum@@ on .
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er kids ?
he was over six .
that was more to em@@ ph@@ as@@ ze .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
was a pretty f@@ ate@@ ful project .
this is stor@@ ing pon@@ in .
and this sounds very different than before .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
but then they really want deep deep .
and the goal here is very simple .
architec@@ ts and engineers , lu@@ ck@@ ily .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
and i had to get away out of the city .
here &apos;s her brand gang .
her father died just after birth .
i started out with my usual talk .
you want to ori@@ ent yourself in the museum ?
so this crazy story could be true .
we &apos;ve won some pri@@ ces .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end .
i hold my hand kni@@ fe .
no , i mean it really seriously .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
i put sle@@ e@@ ve back .
and what does that mean for designers ?
it &apos;s to add experience .
these ri@@ vers are taking rapi@@ dly .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of ption in the road .
i learned this from my grandmother .
no , no , not .
one billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
the st@@ ones are color co@@ ded .
we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s about transforma@@ tive arr@@ ange@@ ments .
a has benefits and risks .
we need to think about what br@@ ands .
my brother star@@ ed at me .
who do you really want in@@ form it ?
we can rein@@ vent it .
b@@ j@@ Ã¶r@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
simple , that &apos;s how it will come .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
and that got me up ...
they even bring fund@@ ing .
and often forget the third .
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil going .
it &apos;s dealing on in@@ ak@@ ness sense .
i call this the bright tiger .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
who could have have looked this ?
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
oh my god . oh my god .
we have a lot of process already .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
and it is phosp@@ hor@@ us .
that &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i started an institute to this .
that &apos;s how natural things are imag@@ ined .
this is maybe be trans@@ c@@ ly publi@@ c@@ ly .
in fact , we &apos;ve been re@@ defin@@ ing poverty .
these are ap@@ sar@@ as .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think there are everywhere .
longer than these other two networks .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
the are called today the project car@@ ri@@ ers .
the film was not yet .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
it auto@@ matically wal@@ ks to the right thought .
as we think about north .
they gave their blood pressure up .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud .
the result of that was a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
thank you , but the best part .
and everybody in this room needs in .
we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and nobody seems that seems to be about .
in the people about the ur@@ ine .
the living birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
what would you describe ban ?
the other one had strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s recogni@@ zing something .
there &apos;s also world recor@@ ds as well .
asking , what &apos;s the right ?
this is more than 250 thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
they &apos;re very well .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations need just a few milli@@ seconds .
for energy , i came up with this .
and here you already feel .
the students are divi@@ ded to gra@@ des .
these things are logi@@ cal .
let &apos;s say what you feel .
completely tar@@ ge@@ goal , goal goal goal goal goal goal , goal goal , to goal goal , goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal , , goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal on goal dest@@ ination .
he died , broken by history .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
it &apos;s interested in the fire .
he sig@@ ned up .
so here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
let &apos;s make a small balance .
here the building works .
you always lose rare animals .
they went through each other .
it will touch deeply .
they kept us from being inspired .
i represent people in death cells .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
i wrote these crazy things .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i think that &apos;s cool .
let &apos;s start to see this .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
so there are two cy@@ cles .
we built unique elements here .
that sounds basically unusual .
so this is a tough nu@@ t .
so ... doesn &apos;t mean so optimi@@ stic .
especially when it died .
it &apos;s const@@ ant .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
so scot@@ t gets this kind of an@@ fru@@ le .
poli@@ dly , all of appl@@ au@@ d .
now take a look at this cur@@ ve .
so i followed my gut sen@@ sation .
they &apos;ve literally la@@ ed the le@@ ver .
lead some mu@@ tations .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
ad@@ oles@@ ties are just bel@@ ong to our lives .
what do you think next ?
we worked until night .
they have them . they always have them .
by@@ product is clean water .
he moved back to sil@@ ence .
it turns off the eng@@ off .
it might take to be invited .
i read you the post .
j@@ im@@ my im@@ im@@ mel came in .
so from the modern to computer society .
and curi@@ osity isn &apos;t learn .
we &apos;re talking tw@@ ality of it .
we go through initi@@ ation ritu@@ als .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
this is &quot; world without oil .
mechan@@ ism is from lying .
the main man was win@@ ding me to me .
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , pre@@ cis@@ ely .
no , i thought .
that &apos;s not usually the rou@@ te .
these are all eng@@ aging questions .
look at what it does .
and that &apos;s what i felt . .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
it &apos;s just less destruction .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe believe about .
but with the right design , please .
how would you describe your brand ?
we can support them be good .
something strange is happening here .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
what will those three billion people bring ?
we also got very pre@@ cise data .
it was really profound .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system in which we live in .
we can support them be good .
and women succe@@ ed ed that .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
you should have you any wish you as well .
even cat@@ s look at this video .
the roof was also covered in water .
this is a painting of a circle .
let &apos;s start sun@@ day .
this is a paradig@@ m shift .
but i continu@@ ed to ask these questions .
she wasn &apos;t yet dro@@ w@@ ned .
you can see it from the back to the front .
i never met him personally .
we need to get far , and quickly .
sexual re@@ production comes into the picture .
we talk about old , fresh .
he was sha@@ king his head , no .
i thought everybody could do this .
but today we are way beyond that .
they ta@@ p their internet connection .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
this will take place in the next apri@@ l .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are mobile phones in the future .
they &apos;re the home countries of somebody .
what does five milli@@ seconds take ?
i see d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
so that &apos;s the reason this project .
p@@ ace is completely paraly@@ zed today .
it &apos;s cru@@ el millions of people .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
this is an ec@@ network .
knows what that is ?
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
and i want to read them .
and there &apos;s just of staf@@ f .
make it possible -- all of you here .
the thing that has just been repres@@ ented .
so it &apos;s a feedback .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people later .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
and why ? gene@@ tically changed food .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ it is open source .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t . &quot;
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
no , no , far missing .
the che@@ f had coo@@ ked him .
&quot; you didn &apos;t go . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is such a part .
the sh@@ ore is from a different place .
we have mas@@ ers in this country now .
you can be logi@@ cal and be intui@@ tive .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
and that was the out@@ break of this .
so the first exciting pri@@ mate .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
maybe i did it with good reason .
it &apos;s not even the truth to free it .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
also , these sources are inter@@ rup@@ tions .
maybe need to look at it .
states of these things don &apos;t exist in us .
we can give something like this ourselves .
15@@ 6 nations are sending our television chan@@ nel .
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
we live in a really extraordinary period of time .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks .
also has a role .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
they &apos;re gone . gone .
to say by a own , what is information ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
i learned some very simple things .
you put this like the box .
it can know how keep it .
they grow out out five centi@@ ches .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
there was never a time like this before .
this is a mo@@ ble little ap@@ p .
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct .
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
thank you dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
his personal impres@@ sions of the se@@ ero@@ ses .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
because now you can apply a sentence .
and you can see the whole thing again .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the guy in the middle is not so much in the middle .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
a bow@@ l cool whi@@ p .
and then he can walk away .
i have on my laptop . &quot;
he has to process that as a present .
i try this by an example .
you can see the ti@@ mel@@ ine at the top .
here &apos;s two different je@@ wel@@ ry facili@@ ties .
the goal of the film is transpar@@ ency .
there &apos;s a lot of things that needs to come together .
and what do you do with the tr@@ ash ?
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
but it &apos;s not just words .
what you need is a new medical culture .
do you want to come there and listen ? &quot;
we get an absolutely flat line about this .
he just wanted to share rain@@ bo@@ w .
what about this ? pretty good .
by alone , as@@ ham@@ ed without support .
i was totally conf@@ used .
in many cases these people are perfectly healthy .
it was a grou@@ per .
my cou@@ s@@ ins walked around .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al di@@ af@@ of of water flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
they condu@@ ct the process , they understand it .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate directly with the artist .
we don &apos;t want companies to have to own see@@ ds .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
the next step happened within these communities .
it all comes from our own po@@ ckets .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to context .
he had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
sh@@ tz the environment , make less waste .
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
a language is the human mind .
ordinary people are not acc@@ essi@@ ble . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else now .
i get ti@@ red , like all of us .
but the game is a sha@@ pe@@ -@@ trans@@ duc@@ er .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
sleep lack is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
it should con@@ tain the two elements again .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show it to you .
yeah . it does nothing else .
thank you . i have a question for you .
this is ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
but i &apos;ll talk about that in a moment .
but western governments also help themselves .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gical it was a disaster .
that really sol@@ ves the fuel problem .
this is my super@@ market . not a big one .
it just didn &apos;t , you know ?
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural videos .
in other areas -- the world of communic@@ ations .
thank you , that was incredible .
this is one , part of her .
the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
this is just the c@@ el by the way .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what do i appe@@ for ?
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
does not enough half or quar@@ ter ? &quot;
you can predict this . why does this work ?
so what can we conclu@@ de from all of this ?
it &apos;s great this number up .
this country is different from the 40 years ago .
she was a sla@@ ve family daughter .
so basically a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
and further , now you always see it .
so far , this was a problem for super@@ computers .
the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f pulled all the str@@ ands .
there are many great books on this top@@ ic .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can tor@@ ture .
two hours , it moves everywhere .
by now , the instru@@ ments have moved on .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a li@@ p pen .
man 3 : i &apos;m the guy .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sent@@ ences .
you still know three-@@ plac@@ ds from school .
i want to explain that a little bit .
in fact wanted to make no vi@@ ral video .
do you remember the wind ?
mon@@ day : color is something powerful .
and then it usually looks like this .
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficient .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
they make worse for that .
it &apos;s the average performance of bat .
so , help me do this .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
if you burn coal , no .
the amo@@ unts of water have been exp@@ and@@ ing .
we wonder@@ ed around , and nobody knew it .
it sort of wired us .
you know science is not a company .
and you can continue the list end@@ less@@ ly .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
let &apos;s say , there &apos;s no predi@@ ction .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
second hal@@ f-@@ time . the end of the normal game time .
everyone &apos;s e@@ aten ca@@ ie .
if you burn natural gas no .
so what are arch@@ a@@ models now ?
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
so , that was my primary motivation .
sustainable proteins , he said .
let me show you how they work .
you can easily zo@@ om very easily .
maybe we can think of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence as a change .
it &apos;s not much better .
imagine for a moment .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
we &apos;re thinking about energy sc@@ ar@@ city today .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
so that really ble@@ my mind .
now , can you play them to me in blue ?
people suff@@ ered . people .
imagine an airplane full smo@@ ke .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s more like the nor@@ m to that .
no , we realize what &apos;s inside .
raise your hands . let me see .
and let &apos;s just it with an example .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
you go around and am@@ use itself .
go america america . find more .
i call them &quot; coming billion .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
sh@@ tz the environment , use less energy .
you should tell me something about my brand .
third , es@@ cal@@ ation expec@@ tations .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
my fourth techni@@ que : assu@@ mption of complexity .
i thought i could integra@@ te .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
and that &apos;s great because we need .
i work in the solar technology industry .
i wanted to re@@ store the health after a disease .
now , if you think for a piece of further .
my parents are 80 on the he@@ els .
this is the machine below the bottom of gen@@ ev@@ a .
and let me show you a simple example .
if not , it squ@@ h somebody else today .
we still think they &apos;re origin@@ ally .
you just listen , and then you start talking .
and the two last ones are here today .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
but reality is always un@@ predic@@ table .
life had not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
i remember it as if it had been yesterday .
here &apos;s a chance to do something .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning in information . &quot;
i tried to preser@@ ve the body .
we forced them . pu@@ ff .
it cap@@ ms a eff@@ t@@ less &apos;s a thousand square kilometers .
you &apos;re going to come in in two ways -- very simple .
well , i walked to the court .
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
because that &apos;s evidence with it , right ?
they laugh@@ ed more than you do here .
you can go into a particular year .
we re@@ je@@ ct gene@@ tically changed food .
the three words : remember ?
they &apos;re in the back of the back of our body .
what ? it really fre@@ ak@@ ed me out .
and there &apos;s problem .
it was something we knew to do .
this is what &apos;s called the o@@ o@@ i model .
but so many were getting over the years over help .
third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
chromo@@ some went to the cell .
we &apos;re in the middle of transition .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
their problem is they too little .
now i &apos;m going to add a b@@ ass .
my mother asked us to hand .
i wouldn &apos;t let rid of that .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality happens in many different forms .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
no one has to give light to your ideas .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked with red .
i think i may have heard more hands .
so that &apos;s what the super@@ market is like .
scot@@ t was talking from human to human to human .
it &apos;s all that is useful .
our goal was to say , okay .
seriously -- the de@@ mis@@ y !
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
so go ; save the shoes .
we always create new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
what do you do to do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
and yeah , i &apos;ll go on a slide more .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this too .
yet we seem to be satis@@ fied with this .
and if not , dance your dance .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in it .
so that made sense , it fit together .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citi@@ zen .
and this is a million company .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
then he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed me into my ear .
mot@@ ors , four op@@ tions .
and this is very important in medical research .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody completely intui@@ tive .
so again , it fit really good together .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
and then it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the different images .
there can be a order of changes .
we need to use more research fun@@ ds .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well plan@@ ned .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
what would you say to somebody who belie@@ ves that ?
let me show you out of the ne@@ ar@@ by .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious .
this has to go down , to zero .
this is al@@ fre@@ d al@@ fre@@ d z@@ ale@@ z .
and over time , they can re@@ act others .
sh@@ ame . sh@@ wer .
is it about the details or the colors ?
so they can &apos;t put them up@@ side down .
all of it is com@@ pos@@ able .
the internet and its services is a mira@@ cle .
so here &apos;s couple a couple in the ham@@ p@@ tons .
what we want is to create the future .
this is going to be bal@@ an@@ ced in china in a second .
my grand@@ parents were pus@@ hing that number to 70 .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
now , this carto@@ on does some stat@@ ements .
the first is a classi@@ c , apple .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
you &apos;re all back on their way .
pic@@ as@@ so ans@@ wer@@ es , just wait .
so two cou@@ ples , each baby has a baby .
and we keep increasing our expec@@ tations all the time .
and i went back to work .
now , i &apos;m going to take out the need@@ le now .
that the ec@@ ology is a global .
story@@ telling uses more and more senses .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
now i &apos;m going to do something more more dru@@ this .
i was totally science thri@@ ll@@ ed , you know .
i have to say i don &apos;t understand .
this is going to be a key element of this evidence .
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy between priv@@ acy and safety .
no one &apos;t done that of the world have done world .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
next week , this comes to the market .
natural provi@@ des smart grid .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
we just sig@@ ned at first .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they live with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
so i think we need to be leading .
ladies and gentle@@ men , your relationships .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
so i &apos;m going to choose the issue of the government .
and they had to re@@ move them what we did .
the question is why people accept .
i mean , no one &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
there &apos;s every foot@@ print is dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged .
and every night , they fly back 2@@ 40 kilometers .
first i thought this was a game .
so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
it &apos;s got a butt@@ on .
well , was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true .
let &apos;s pre@@ tend we have a machine here .
these things have a positive effect .
there was no childhood in the back .
what &apos;s for@@ aging ? &quot;
on the left , you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the rest of the they &apos;re del@@ c@@ alized .
nobody wanted to do with the movie .
and try the whole thing again with another generation .
thank you very much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
every morning , they fly 40 kilometers to the farm .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of mas@@ ers .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rec@@ tly .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is vote .
and of course , it made click .
and i have to say , there was power to me .
at i 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
the best part is still -- in a second .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
it &apos;s not come out yet .
i want to show you something about first of all .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
i didn &apos;t want to ; i love my life .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
i never want to move in life a little more .
do know what to call a 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ ter ?
it suppor@@ ts others talk about their mistakes .
it &apos;s all . it &apos;s all online .
what happened is we could do that .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
why do we do that ? why do we ?
there had to be another piece of puzz@@ le .
that &apos;s how you communicate -- this is how fing@@ ers walk along .
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
for example , for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , right ?
i put them , and i went to the treatment .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it was summer , and i had shor@@ ts .
they don &apos;t invest in time in power char@@ ms .
notice two things about this cur@@ ve .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
and we want to make this material available for all of them .
and i that &apos;s good .
we want to do something about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
this is a problem that a lot of players have .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
so smart grid , a huge top@@ ic everywhere .
the last three of the five i &apos;ve sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed .
so each conc@@ ert is conc@@ ert .
in fact , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
instead , look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
and we need to improve a lot about this device .
it was born four and four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and still a reali@@ stic level .
and everything is pac@@ k@@ aging or content .
there are some high-@@ interesting develop@@ ments there .
so not &apos;t save , avoid .
he would roll over the country .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge that for nine .
he came to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
am i really sorry . does this make crazy ?
everybody who were started divi@@ ding .
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation .
and i &apos;m going to sum@@ mar@@ ize that for a moment for you .
it was much loo@@ on , and i was a hur@@ ry .
technical cy@@ cles is the same .
anyway . that &apos;s what i certainly want that .
now , everyone in this pattern is trying to see something .
we don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identity , we inv@@ ent it .
so she &apos;s to come from the outside to man .
come on , dance . thank you .
in the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society through language .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted him here .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they in@@ ver@@ ted the flow of the water .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood , it &apos;s gone .
and in that head , the memory played .
and what does it look like in actually ?
and that was what i found very very exciting .
we understood that the weather is global .
you seemed to have seen it in the news .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern of development .
i have something i want to show you .
in the countries people get money .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
store it off , d@@ ele@@ up the rest .
how about living longer at good health ?
did you take your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
the only thing they had was their head .
information is any difference makes a difference .
no apple ever ever sted that again .
dna down was an interesting step .
so that was strange experience .
and to give you back to my th@@ ie@@ cian .
everywhere over these di@@ a@@ pers are almost .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
but what happens to citizens is different .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
we want to lower the number of pris@@ on@@ ers .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand ger@@ ry ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel money .
there were no can@@ tal mel@@ ons .
so for him , they were just cl@@ blocks .
one thought i &apos;d have no@@ ney st@@ cks .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the chain of lab@@ el .
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
the sil@@ ence is ear is ear an@@ es@@ the@@ zing .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters is right here .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all the time .
as i said , am@@ anda , it car@@ ries our ele@@ ce .
they &apos;re vi@@ able , both both up .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
i remember it was yesterday .
all of these are sum@@ mar@@ i@@ , er@@ r@@ ors are inevi@@ table .
so you don &apos;t lose the animals ahead .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we have access to exponenti@@ al technology tools .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
they become less r@@ ar@@ er because we catch them .
there seems to be an dis@@ agre@@ ement .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
and we see that it comes out .
we &apos;ve been doing it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
in fact , coal is not dir@@ ty .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
this is something like our fight .
that means we &apos;ve got to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and out of me becomes a character in the book .
so i think the bas@@ ics are very simple .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
i think first of all is the curi@@ osity .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
the drive on the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so each dro@@ p@@ let was a little bit different .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
the answer will be &quot; no .
you know how many people look at these ted@@ talks ?
not everything should be com@@ pos@@ able , of course .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
here are the results we just got .
there are those ones more more tial .
these were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
now , would you choose vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
we found that it &apos;s moving really strange .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
good night , swe@@ et mar@@ yl@@ pi@@ s . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking .
it &apos;s bar@@ ely talked about education .
the next thing you want to talk about .
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
and that all leads us to one big question ...
in 2010 , it was looked at 23 million times .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
she had the last word in every family argument .
transition happens . we can all feel .
and in my you@@ th , i said expec@@ tation .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
if you gener@@ alize it happens .
it &apos;s about an behavior act po@@ op print .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard to diagno@@ sis .
i was a comp@@ vely obs@@ essi@@ ve student .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he just dec@@ ei@@ ve you and not himself .
it &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
... that the do@@ si@@ es also play a role .
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and finally , let we wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
we don &apos;t want to try and try and tell the future before .
well , i understand that . i do .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
i learned that in a moment , everything different .
this is recor@@ ots over a period of six seconds .
and you ask , what happens to those moments ?
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and this is planning behind stu@@ x@@ net .
this is the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
or they didn &apos;t have phot@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
well , really good , maybe a all@@ -@@ star .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
and we use this word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
now he &apos;s going to get a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
and i have all little pro@@ ps here .
you &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
because we can &apos;t live without that li@@ fes@@ pan .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
and that was an experience in hu@@ mili@@ ty to me .
wealth , not de@@ bt affec@@ ts the result .
this is just online -- press , no television .
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us any money .
but leaving is not always a bad thing .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
i think a lot of you in this room room room know this trick .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
why do i have to afford a little car like this ?
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ or .
i want to tell you how we found that .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means health .
phr@@ ase with his own breath .
or are you more like a down at@@ tri@@ te ?
i can make the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
and they also feel their mov@@ ements and tenden@@ cy .
i made the decision to the u.s. .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the mag@@ ts .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say about this .
so we have 1.@@ 5 billion players in total .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
so my two passi@@ ons have inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed .
yeah , what projects are we actually doing now ?
she bar@@ ely brea@@ thing , and she had walking in blue .
and the world we lived like this .
8@@ ,000 players played the game eight weeks .
i had a relationship with this beauty over months of months .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
it &apos;s nat@@ , and it &apos;s just nat@@ .
from a@@ vi@@ an age to the machine age .
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
but are we going to make the best out of our game drive ?
this is the call center for service information .
this is the teacher sh@@ ame .
but one of them is much worse than the other one .
we have the passion of a di@@ y-@@ inno@@ v@@ ators .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , tiny , little idea .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law last hundred years .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
now we &apos;re going to do this with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
em@@ c : &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
we have all the navi@@ gation systems in our cars .
and so it &apos;s not percei@@ ved as a great loss .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing in the dis@@ ab@@ led rights movement .
we want to elimin@@ sh mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
there &apos;s a connection , another respect .
and we want to bring this to a global .
but you know what you &apos;re not right to ?
they virtu@@ alize reality , and it &apos;s without computers .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the po@@ ker on in a moment .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
so we &apos;re going away of it , and where do we walk ?
there &apos;s a program that some of you may know with .
i agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
the under@@ water part comes from a quar@@ ry .
the people in the side are are coming in now .
they need that , and we won &apos;t give it to them .
if you want to make it hyper@@ hyper@@ on the left between the images .
and some of it worked and not some of it .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
we wanted to develop a language lear@@ ner .
the child in me is really excited about such possibilities .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty question is an interesting question .
do you want to be more more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
the first question is , are we too many ?
today i &apos;m going to report un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
but you &apos;re not be able to replace the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
tu@@ es@@ day , custom@@ i@@ zation is totally over@@ r@@ ated .
when i say a reality , i mean photo reality .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
i have another 40 40 years in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the dog ! i was l@@ l@@ to be l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic .
i seems important to uni@@ te both .
and how about you ? what &apos;s successful ?
right now , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
it was , &quot; in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , forever . &quot;
and it was that same then after the three months .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
then i say heart par@@ ity , right ?
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand understand the possibilities of this yet .
you know he was here in 18@@ 35 .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , patent whe@@ el .
the main problem here is the like it is in aids .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a say about reality .
my mother suff@@ ered from from the boat .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the staf@@ f anymore .
and we often rein@@ ent as often as we want .
have a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of this .
we see this in all sorts of parts of human life .
these are the people who shape my world@@ view .
these results were achie@@ ved hard work for several weeks .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for re@@ ception .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
it also shows in other places of the book .
another favorite picture , star night .
and , lu@@ ck@@ ily , there &apos;s a lot of studies on this now .
and i went over and just listen@@ ed .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot;
this player is just in front of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
in each of these five areas , we need at at least 100 people .
li@@ ke@@ wise , i think we &apos;re putting games today .
and i said , &quot; yes , i love very much . &quot;
you can say things here that have the world &apos;s influence .
... , you could show the slide for a moment .
probably one of these numbers must get very close to zero .
and we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
the first two sent@@ ences are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a stat@@ ement about what &apos;s true .
so imagine two other little changes .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
what we &apos;ve yed with with is the story@@ telling .
we can continue these different examples .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
this should not not be a jo@@ ke at all , but .
and that &apos;s kind a bit of the message .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
how many would choose for good memory ?
so please listen when a music is played .
so , go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth ading .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ r@@ ate the destruction .
so you could feel about selling it .
and we can like to look at this .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ i@@ i@@ of er@@ ors .
so my way of making films completely .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
that &apos;s how the sou@@ l works .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
there are some places we can turn to .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it &apos;s ob@@ li@@ isi@@ e and strange programs .
so here &apos;s natural flies .
that means the ants wei@@ gh much more than us .
go o and squ@@ aw@@ fish leon@@ ard co@@ hen . in@@ x@@ ever
i said , &quot; promise , grandmother . &quot;
because they have special skills of the process@@ on .
his whole process changed .
we called it the digital water pa@@ vil@@ li@@ on .
you can look around all these muse@@ ums .
how much money takes to realize this ?
lo@@ ans and spon@@ spon@@ sor@@ s have been se@@ arch@@ ed .
and i took a while to figure that out .
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic .
i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classi@@ cal expres@@ sions in playing .
and if not , then it doesn &apos;t do .
and we designed an i@@ pad ap@@ p .
this is another gli@@ mp@@ se of the tree of life .
we didn &apos;t have a child paraly@@ sis in this country yesterday .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
they moved to a concept .
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue .
i think that &apos;s true of every human being on the planet .
child mortality has a tent@@ h .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
there &apos;s no population problem in trees .
so these women met and just talked .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
so he got the citizens to check them .
imagine a so@@ und@@ scap@@ y airplane .
he says , &quot; en@@ rich@@ me for the pr@@ all . &quot;
so we &apos;re going to start with a windows windows dro@@ one .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom into two hal@@ ves .
&quot; take a look at your bel@@ es , p@@ ink .
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
i &apos;m looking forward to conver@@ sa@@ tions with all of you .
you zo@@ om in . you can actually go in .
you have to be willing to take risks .
if you have something to give , give it now .
next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
cle@@ e@@ y coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
they teach them open do@@ ors .
so in other words , i define what i want .
we re@@ tioned it , we re@@ pair it .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and it s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in summer .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
we dance in the temp@@ le and we become god . &quot;
and i see the same process combin@@ ing with photos .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ ade .
those who make the scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : hu@@ g your inner child .
it was at almost 200 million times this year .
not just bad , but of worst worst time .
this is the con@@ sequence we have to face .
or are they more like a down@@ down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
i don &apos;t see a reason why this shouldn &apos;t be that way .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and the world we live in now looks like this .
it &apos;s actually much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
the only problem was she had 10 children .
i said , &quot; please fly air . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build bom@@ b .
but these are all streets in the u.s. .
and she said the three words : you remember ?
play is the ti@@ that that hol@@ ps us together .
how would you want to be better than you are now ?
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a paraly@@ charge .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
so , there &apos;s climate change is going to be terrible to you .
but the volu@@ me are much greater than ever before .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so gender can occu@@ r in many different var@@ ie@@ ties .
are they ei@@ ei@@ ful ful and mon@@ on@@ um@@ ous like 00@@ 7 ?
and less us@@ able or user is friend@@ ly .
and at all , you worked much less than i did .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
he described one of them as very common .
you may have heard that we built water@@ sig@@ ns .
as a result of that we &apos;re building up stron@@ ger social relationships .
we &apos;re into the arms of the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
so that &apos;s also there , and then that coming back .
i &apos;m never going to play the way i did at that moment .
mani@@ ok is something half a billion people eat .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open them do@@ ors ?
and these were sort of the first of people developed play devices .
and there are projects like this at every government level .
so the occu@@ py@@ thes@@ e@@ c movement has done it .
i mean , i r@@ ar@@ ely seen so flat lines .
but what about that day that fri@@ day ?
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; idea ; it &apos;s a process .
here &apos;s the up@@ ated version of this input .
we should put the bear in the c@@ age .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
or b because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
you get a model that emer@@ ges from all the earth .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its sense each other .
and it &apos;s also deep ro@@ ot@@ ed in our lives .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we re@@ turned to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
it was an extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
the survi@@ vor@@ s self doesn &apos;t have a voice in that ele@@ ction .
where &apos;s the biggest interest in really imple@@ ing something like this ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
we &apos;re now using on fu@@ els of the fourth generation .
it &apos;s the form of re@@ four behavior , right ?
at one point , the screen fil@@ ls with leaves .
and also , the energy cycle is very important for them .
the grand@@ father of this old man re@@ f@@ used .
how can i make something a use friend@@ ly ?
this year it was looked at almost 50 million times .
every society is sha@@ ped by a primary medium .
now the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
they &apos;re in the united states , they &apos;re in europe and japan .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction .
and no , it &apos;s not or san francisco .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of the head .
because artists have a dis@@ ra@@ ti@@ o to lying .
well , chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
and professional ol@@ Ã© ! hu@@ ness for you , despite all of this .
i &apos;ll still keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
well , today we know about where our things come from .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can di@@ ve into a decade .
well , we pres@@ ented the ma@@ yo@@ r of bel@@ hole .
so i say , let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games start !
because we &apos;re not doing things more free of us .
he steel every five hope from my consciousness .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of too many choices .
this is an inter@@ active anima@@ ster .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
we had no words for what we started there .
i &apos;d rather keep doing this work i love .
in the future , most cri@@ mes will play online .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest ever sold . &quot;
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital is hit@@ ting the physical .
fr@@ ance makes a gate . it@@ al@@ y makes a pi@@ ate@@ way .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
there &apos;s &apos;t even him online . no stre@@ aming .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online playing online .
also urban designers and buil@@ ders are very interested .
30 years ago , this would be ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
how would you change your relationships and negative energy in it ?
is it possible for others or is it affec@@ for us ?
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the rat@@ s .
we &apos;re talking here -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t hold yourself .
we tried to get to the point of the auto@@ ma@@ tion .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ age and un@@ accu@@ rate .
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a fol@@ ks@@ scientist .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s still being put together .
&quot; doesn &apos;t go &quot; pro@@ ved to be un@@ true .
and then we &apos;re off@@ ering ering one of these great dun@@ es .
now , in this area there are several thousand goals in this area .
the cell communities started to abstra@@ ct information .
and everybody knew it worked , right ?
there &apos;s going to be more of my glas@@ ses .
as i said , it first came it off .
now it &apos;s on a en@@ danger@@ ed species on the red list .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ g .
how do you ju@@ dge people because because of their characters ?
the biggest difference between them is dealing with time .
but i really believe that something is coming after us .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
the next step was to find the app@@ s .
which other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ sen have you go through ?
this const@@ ant feedback that doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as other br@@ gs .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
you want to tell your stories . you want to share your stories .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
we know one more where all of the gas sta@@ tions are .
so the growth rate itself is acceler@@ ating .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this gold fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to take it for you , and then &apos;ll explain it .
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ ve , what &apos;s in there .
in both cases , they surgery , and they were fine .
it says , &quot; put your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
so you just go to google t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
a research se@@ me@@ ster of natural user interface design .
that &apos;s the truth . but the studio didn &apos;t know .
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the middle .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
i sell museum animals across the country around the world .
many of them are covered in faces faces and so on .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn this around .
now , how do people die in a result of such ha@@ cks ?
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
1@@ m is the highest thing i saw .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the remin@@ der itself .
these are spaces that can respond to a human .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to that .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe like this .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
both of them were ked in me , ask me up .
that &apos;s why to think about the wei@@ to to wei@@ gh .
we were were cul@@ ing around around the way as we did .
many are talking about a 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 .
now that is lar@@ gely our goal .
so if kl@@ aus says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
i was actually obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep sea .
this is the har@@ dest part in my talk , by the way .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same .
i can &apos;t play today as i did 20 years .
as a child , i constantly com@@ ic books and so on .
in the course of this vo@@ y@@ age of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
if we start thinking about it this way , everything changes .
this is star night , probably never before .
our steps in the di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zation of life were exponenti@@ al .
we have an abstra@@ ct an abstra@@ cted language .
an@@ law@@ yer : i &apos;m a brand .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
i worked in a co@@ al@@ min@@ ing work -- dangerous .
another example is what we called virtual reality .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental dis@@ connection .
it gave to crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing attention .
she hadn &apos;t suff@@ ered a treat@@ able brain damage .
it could happen within a time learning learning work .
that means the crime als go back .
and of course , how design affec@@ on perception .
so how does a human doing to some things accor@@ to this .
there he was le@@ w@@ ing and he said , like this ?
they put them the the machine .
ok , think of it as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cr@@ us@@ ade against drugs .
here &apos;s what &apos;s happening is so gen@@ nan@@ it machine age .
there , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
this is an extraordinary honor for me .
everything that beautiful in life is not efficient .
and the fish was also fortun@@ ate enough to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
there &apos;s even more behind it , it &apos;s even deeper .
but we know very little about where things go .
as it used to happen in the village d@@ ately .
i know what people think when they &apos;re going to see that .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
but actually , it was an even greater fun that night .
but together , can com@@ bine something something special like this .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , not a h@@ d , it was real .
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to honor ?
it was called auto@@ matically conne@@ ging stone . &quot;
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ eu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great em@@ power@@ acy of humanity .
in fact , the pro@@ gr@@ ession society is based on energy advan@@ ces .
because you know , this is a fun process .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
that &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
and this is actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our big problems .
go america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
the idea is to list a digital security system .
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
he took a famous picture . what was ?
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
click , and w@@ um@@ ms , you &apos;re in this museum .
or other models , or even speci@@ fi@@ cations .
i wasn &apos;t long time there with mi@@ gu@@ el .
we see the process fe@@ eding on itself .
fro@@ sty , the carb@@ man gets cle@@ aner every day .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication .
th@@ yl@@ pi@@ ines ? yes . vi@@ alive ? y@@ ap .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
because the images made it real for you .
that &apos;s great . i love plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
ph@@ ph@@ , ro@@ tube , child paraly@@ sis ...
so i take a step back and i take the perspective .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
she was a gun , strong strong woman , effect .
the bre@@ p ch@@ ures they still still describe them as pri@@ st@@ ine .
so soon , should should figure out what the goal is is .
so in some sense , technology is over@@ wh@@ pped us .
so i know about some who haven not car@@ ed in .
i fil@@ med in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
but what if you want to see the pain@@ t@@ br@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the legi@@ ti@@ mate .
and then they hi@@ red a whole lot of simu@@ lations .
and so he flo@@ ws his ag@@ oni@@ zing states .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really serious ?
it &apos;s this gent@@ going , coo@@ ked fla@@ vor .
we can actually do the same things less energy .
if the child is born , it looks it looks like a girl .
i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
if we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
because the musical instrument is the exten@@ sion of our bodies .
it &apos;s like asking someone to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds .
well , the energy cycle has fallen over time .
can you imagine something good coming from to@@ bac@@ co ?
my grand@@ father was in ja@@ il during the pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
a baby needs about six th di@@ a@@ pers .
it caused im@@ men@@ se ju@@ g in the control room .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive jo@@ ker .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a spon@@ ge .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
this is not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
he only lived nin@@ and 30 years .
a few years ago , i started to develop li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its .
imagine these ima@@ points could really start to fly .
what &apos;s this new state for the world slowly ?
a friend of mine did it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
and my talk today is going to be about these cognitive fall .
open the map , and jump with a click .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
and i don &apos;t expect that &apos;s ever going to change .
it &apos;s also my great , li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and this is an econom@@ ist . so he logi@@ cal .
it &apos;s not just a nice so@@ und@@ -@@ pe@@ te .
you know , we &apos;re actually hearing a whole lot about transpar@@ ency right now .
and the predic@@ tions of how they read them are serious .
please follow me because the circle will close again .
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol diseases .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and what i got was it was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and today we &apos;re still very very , very much on stories .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w !
and i can tell you was a changing experience .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ ving .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
i have a friend driving pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
you have to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a big choice .
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m technology to spread .
we also brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools .
let &apos;s call the animal beginn@@ cher , it costs a lot of money .
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
i was fascin@@ ated by elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this , hundreds .
why are you adverti@@ sing around us , if we can &apos;t buy ?
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
i said , &quot; we try to go against in@@ justice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thank you .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing gal@@ area .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption of what &apos;s going on here .
50 percent of their decisions were been made within nine minutes or less .
well , i play with you sometimes , but not very often .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-@@ community .
but my logi@@ cal side didn &apos;t like it either .
this is the period of time you &apos;re in love with .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
if one neighb@@ or helps the other , we em@@ then our communities .
i mean , how much do es from our memor@@ ies ?
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the colle@@ ctions .
this is simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
and because we grow older , the di@@ a@@ pers get bigger .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of stat@@ ds .
i just want to say you brie@@ fly about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
but can you , if you &apos;re in exten@@ foreign .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
i hope you &apos;ll look to it . thank you .
and then i immediately fall in , that &apos;s un@@ fair .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it .
and the film will be called &quot; the greatest ever ever sold . &quot;
secon@@ dly , photos combin@@ ed photographs have the same kind of ligh@@ ination .
and also what you would think in the mind today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to out of it .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and the oil be able to replace that with other energy car@@ ri@@ ers .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
ten minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a break .
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
just that i think he rather like it , right ?
and then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has forces .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i mentioned mi@@ gu@@ el , el he kid@@ ding .
this is a lot of dea@@ ths by mas@@ ses , 20 per hour .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
but it turns out this is not all yet .
because you &apos;re the ones who are experts in fla@@ vor .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might see .
so there should better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i can &apos;t do it .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logi@@ cal .
that our survival is connected to each one &apos;s survival .
so the pain@@ ker of the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
the more money you make the happy you are .
this approach is true of everything new we do creative .
and they took the way through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
we &apos;ve earlier moved in the so-@@ called a@@ vi@@ an age .
now , your living self is not going to be happ@@ ier .
this is the publi@@ cation we &apos;ve just finished recently .
there is a series of photographs somewhere here they are .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 if a bat 300 beat .
since that time , we &apos;ve been main@@ tain@@ ed all kinds of recogni@@ tion .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding you for this morning , &quot; he said .
this is 20 feet by sea level , like green@@ land .
this is a picture of an k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
in 2010 , we had just connected this under two billion people online .
i studied prin@@ ter , and she was in brea@@ thing .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for someone here in this audience .
and this was the first time i learned this myself .
a very specific wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
i can say the doctor is a man .
now i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
he has a 15 for@@ aging from 15 to one .
and all that time , i colle@@ cted more and more knowledge .
it was completely ex@@ clu@@ ded that it could fail .
even who kill@@ s somebody , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer .
and this video was actually finished in janu@@ ary .
you know , there were no mand@@ ins in par@@ ad@@ ise .
they are , in a , inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the things .
this is what you can do your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
we &apos;ve been using in h@@ oll@@ and and we &apos;ve now over three years .
so that got me right , and i wanted more .
yeah , this is what one bur@@ den is down there .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
depen@@ ding on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
there &apos;s many lot more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
the fact is that this un@@ certain@@ ty should worry about us .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
a couple of months went on , and i had just for@@ gotten everything .
and immediately i see another pattern emer@@ exists .
each of these issues , of course , made many , many smaller decisions .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient .
and all of a sudden , it didn longer longer seem human human .
and i celebra@@ te , i &apos;m cr@@ ying like a little kid .
players are ma@@ sters of po@@ ets in spi@@ ders .
so people in the west have thought about creativity for a long time .
if you &apos;re happy , you attra@@ ct other happy people .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
this is the same , bad team became one under the best .
and of course , they can never be in germany . &quot;
one con@@ sequence was that the phone was never broken .
and the open i talked , the more i should tell .
how can we trans@@ mit those feelings from play into reality ?
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit into my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s on@@ gs to it .
an amazing er@@ ror rate . one in nine inno@@ cent .
or you want to be fit@@ ter , stron@@ ger , have more power .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents all died when they were 60 .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;ll talk about in a moment .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is them , in a , all in the pre-@@ wind phase .
in they are , they want to the end of the gan@@ gs .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boys as man@@ ents .
we &apos;ve been used to things are going to happen lin@@ ear .
this is , by the way , is sure four out 10 .
you &apos;re very r@@ ar@@ ely actually actually wit@@ wit@@ ness of a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
so i want to show you with two , maybe three examples as well .
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are everywhere
secon@@ dly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
wel@@ come the fear . wel@@ come the risk .
they can throw p away where you go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best thing the fire@@ department .
they did it by sel@@ ec@@ ered the country .
the things that are only being used go into technical systems .
it was a shop called a dra@@ g@@ ger .
then let &apos;s project this analog@@ y into the future .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so there hasn &apos;t changed anything , and yet everything has changed .
are you so far ? you look a little nervous .
so if you were able to turn the light back .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand .
so the device you see that didn &apos;t work .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and as i turn around , the fing@@ ers changes his position .
it looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ bly language .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
that lo@@ ses half of the first year .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to cut so much .
we &apos;re talking about the cur@@ se of information .
there &apos;s a direct back@@ name system .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s looking at this video .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
we see phosp@@ hor@@ us us really critical .
and yeah , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
one beautiful in life is not efficient .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
and i think it makes the world looks like this .
software creation typically takes a few years .
now , where would your brain at this scale ?
now , how do you start talking the language of music ?
we need to rely on the machine of the government .
i sent it home without talking to my ch@@ er .
i just wish i could see my kids up .
and what &apos;s noticed was that that i needed an exper@@ t .
and i trans@@ fer@@ red her to fin@@ ance an expedi@@ tion .
because this is where the real govern@@ ance work is curr@@ ing .
the cost of solar energy dro@@ pped 50 percent last year .
it has moments of life , one after another .
secon@@ , what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ a costs .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
the previous example was about finding details .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we &apos;ve done all this .
i &apos;m expla@@ ining what these sounds might have to mean .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
again , what potential do we want to call off now ?
because all of these new technologies are fe@@ eding themselves .
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , you bu@@ ried it .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
so what i &apos;m telling you right now is what &apos;s truly amazing .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that either . our health care system is mi@@ es .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i knew she had come to go .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
because their lives depen@@ ded on whether they were doing the job right .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
and another example is the ambi@@ tious , intelligent systems .
so they go around and make art instal@@ lations like this .
that &apos;s why you help , ask for people .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it still sm@@ ells well .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach that .
and this &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
a typical wal@@ -@@ m@@ art off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
the program i use is a little experiment .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
but also , our perception itself , how do she dec@@ ei@@ ve us too .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal side is saying .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
how many do@@ ors have the house you live in ?
if we looked at how feelings with income vari@@ ed with income .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
je of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed feed your animals ?
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
so , 10,000 hours is an very interesting number for two reasons .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure pleasure on something we do mit .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the insu@@ lan@@ ders .
i was sho@@ cked and dis@@ ar@@ ded to the inside .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little curious so far .
most of my activi@@ ties , i have two hat@@ s .
you see the person who wonder@@ ks what &apos;s happening inside .
the words as long as his friends , now mo@@ cked his .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . &quot;
what it ru@@ ined was memor@@ ies of the experience .
and first of all , to what what the right thing is .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror , who sha@@ ped her life .
as it turns out dna syn@@ thes@@ ti@@ zation is very difficult .
that kee@@ ps us in the shel@@ f , and kee@@ ps us evol@@ ve .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ b@@ step gui@@ dance there .
well , the memory itself is a story@@ t@@ eller .
i no longer argu@@ ed two years with my wife .
this first one was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next few days .
so , my gentle@@ man , can you help me ? i need help .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is death is part of life .
i started to think i should just come in the project .
the pilot set out the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on their own .
so the driving force behind that is super@@ power .
you know how many decisions you make a typical day ?
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of water , or 40 meters .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous los@@ ses .
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
you put a blue one to a green one , and you can make light .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he dec@@ ei@@ ed her .
more and more people came in because they were an@@ gry .
and what we found in fact , there was a cor@@ relation .
we think about our future of as a for@@ es@@ e@@ tive memor@@ ies .
because music is a language , and it &apos;s a language communicate there .
i want to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
a fish , but also a a@@ vi@@ an reser@@ ve .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love history .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle in her .
yet , we &apos;re still coming in the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away from you .
because by marine prote@@ cted areas , we &apos;re basically re@@ stor@@ ing the past .
how does i look like could i just write down a song ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
so now we blo@@ cked the time sc@@ ales .
sometimes i lose the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . a story at conclu@@ end .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum very , lots many ideas .
the question is , if you can get this to zero ?
we can , of course , look at the problem of waste first .
just to pre@@ cise points of time , you agree .
so the question is , how do we deal with these di@@ a@@ pers ?
so today , evolution can happen in the period of micro@@ seconds .
so , for example , the environment , drive less car .
you &apos;ve got to imagine you at the enormous challenges that they have to face .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of platform .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
most of you are be completely ignor@@ ed by remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
so you can ask : how is this itself ?
has one one in the audience ever ever seen anyone die of mas@@ ers ?
if the museum gave us the picture , click .
you can like to test it in my room in my talk .
i found that technology should make magic possible , and not not kill .
and lives lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
she said it would be like a train th@@ under@@ up .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only getting worse .
so also , in every store you can get things back .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
and she asked him , what are your your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
so if i put them next to each side , that &apos;ll be your interest .
don &apos;t tell me these things have no consequences .
we are cases , like dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bu@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
i was the only one who could talk to the air@@ comp@@ ani@@ ons .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
they dar@@ ken@@ rate your ur@@ ine . it almost more you never do .
but where would the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
the most powerful min@@ ker is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given to my e@@ go room .
almost like like we pre@@ p@@ are for our lives .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just do that .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
we found this in terms of the happiness of living itself .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
so the a@@ wards were , , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re going on .
think of this as a image point , as a image of flying .
you have to make 6@@ 2 different completely design your car .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-@@ book .
this is the source of most coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
usually , most people start to ori@@ ent themselves in terms of the task .
innovation , creativity , and development is not not just coming out of our heads .
if you walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we all need to believe things we can &apos;t see .
if we over@@ do it , we can put a little back .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what allows us to do modern progress .
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ image data .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
let &apos;s call it mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , it &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
i mean , what does anyone going to bring with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
i became the mira@@ cle not not die that day .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
i really like your way , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
then the same thing happens as it does in a good , ju@@ just conversation .
we take pictures of these mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs into dete@@ c@@ tors .
because he doesn &apos;t know what ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack to go first .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement in re@@ ation .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this surro@@ und@@ ings .
car colors , out@@ color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 op@@ tions .
and as a general term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tation ability .
they &apos;re not even come to muse@@ ums , for think .
this is him li@@ f@@ ting a rare equ@@ ta@@ ar .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
and i thought , this was going to be so hard , so pain@@ ful .
p@@ ace is going to be part of the show , which is pretty ri@@ ger@@ ed .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
how did he get for help in this particular way ?
w@@ r wants to help people con@@ vi@@ cted inno@@ cent .
and the best part is perhaps be what a@@ wa@@ cts us in health .
we &apos;re and@@ ro@@ sting and we &apos;re talking to and@@ ro@@ gens .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less har@@ m@@ ful at this .
we could reduce that , of course , by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i sort of think about it the more intui@@ tive it is .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
they have a en percent rene@@ w@@ ables today .
but as you &apos;ve been talking to to different people of the world about these possibilities .
let &apos;s quickly jump to mom@@ a , again in new york .
and if you can it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is technolog@@ y-@@ suppor@@ ted innovation that we have today .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the orig@@ ception .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are with chimpanze@@ es our clo@@ s@@ living rela@@ tives .
now he &apos;s the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
the first of these fall is a con@@ tradi@@ tion to ad@@ mit complexity .
i want to help you with a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
you you just sort of it get just wrong at some , some will come , some people don &apos;t .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be .
they invest a lot of their time assem@@ bly ing growing structures .
you go about the block and you take it as re@@ vel@@ ation .
i take the brea@@ ing the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
but the question i want to throw up is why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks we went back into temp@@ &apos;s room .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s suppor@@ ted .
because frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the ju@@ dge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
ce@@ os are a little about average . but this is where it gets interesting .
here &apos;s one of the evidence of that men are not pig@@ s .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work in my work as a law@@ yer .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play and play with me like this .
and within a few years , le@@ go moved to every hou@@ se@@ hold .
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
and i really want to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
here i &apos;m exp@@ and@@ ing it a bit . we &apos;re looking right at the center here .
so i decided , when i was 15 to be di@@ ver .
this picture , for example has about 10 billion points , i think .
social dec@@ line . speak@@ 7 7 : 65 dead .
new investment to create well-@@ paid jobs .
fire@@ flies in a glass , i always found exciting .
from my eye angle , i looked up the jan@@ it@@ ors and down .
in many of you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re nu@@ ts ! that &apos;s good .
the x-@@ unique interpretation of a piece is compar@@ able .
a long time ago , there was gra@@ y wh@@ ales -- 500 years ago .
that means the player player is going to beat three out of 10 be@@ ats .
and guess what we found in the code of attac@@ ks ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
and they did this with what &apos;s called le@@ ad@@ land maps .
imagine that every one of people is controlled .
how about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
okay , let me squ@@ ee@@ out a little blood for you .
but instead of pan@@ ic , he just stopped .
he invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had half the last year .
but somehow , we &apos;re going to do able to move ourselves from this problem .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
turned the tr@@ ash ton on the site . went home .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so des@@ wing .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just .
we hate a government to strong government . we don &apos;t have any confidence in the system .
i first ate it in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers now , the individual people .
this is an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this code .
so i &apos;ve been working on this , when is , of course , or intui@@ tive .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on all humanity .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
so maybe you should put a little bit about this before the interview . &quot;
we de@@ grade people who worth value for our society .
it means that we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a cultural impact next to the scientific .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime hasn &apos;t changed very much .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pes don &apos;t come to court .
what about child paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we &apos;ve ad@@ ted his bed so that he can see outside .
alone these air@@ port has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
we use games to es@@ cape the real world &apos;s suffering .
and six x-@@ 10 milli@@ seconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
so it turns out to be very hard to get get all of these exten@@ sions .
this goes back a lot further in the pre-@@ industrial times &apos; cultures .
our gut is a wonder@@ fully friend@@ ly environment for this bacteria .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you may know .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let it down .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ support .
the biggest fear were afraid of pi@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
somebody was broken in , and ha@@ cked the system system th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
but a lot of people are in a very strange position .
but bes@@ i@@ des that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
this actually took two thousand eight really shape , these networks .
you don &apos;t need to whi@@ st@@ le a lo@@ or sing sing anymore .
so i think it &apos;s a very successful ha@@ ck .
i brought seven under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange land street .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how can i actually get this over ?
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how to become a fish exper@@ t .
i think somehow this &apos;s six six dollars or something like that .
there was the le@@ o@@ ar &apos;s research facili@@ system .
now , living itself lives his life continu@@ ously .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
well , the two kinds of self throw out two terms of happiness .
photos like this : a construction site along a much comfortable road .
i grew up with a woo@@ den por@@ tion of science fi@@ ction .
a ei@@ ght-@@ , played brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;ll build exten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ sely .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all miner@@ miner@@ als .
and i &apos;m not so sure you you actually stay there .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
they increase paraly@@ sis and lower happiness .
now , that night , they all went to the center to celebra@@ te .
what &apos;s interesting about this is , if i can make a little trip .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
the compon@@ er is more and more of the friend that you live with .
so here finally was a company trying to get it right .
how can a ju@@ dge turn somebody into something not ?
so find programs that can sort the most numbers .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
so a few years ago , i went to do this .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is you .
a couple . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limit@@ ations .
and i said , how do you communicate ? &quot;
why is it important to re@@ laun@@ ch ? what &apos;s the red ?
finally , at the move progress , we should wel@@ come the fear .
that was , i think , a very good code .
this is actually the true mel@@ ting of man and machine .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
how about a set of new , never heard heard .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly encoura@@ ged .
for example , the fish was taken on on a al trip .
that &apos;s what we call in our per@@ cep@@ tual design .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
essentially , the con@@ cre@@ te block had become the building block of our time .
my inspiration comes from an event that lies 2,@@ 500 years .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
ah , the majority . i like to see that , as a physi@@ cian .
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables , as they &apos;re often called .
and the best part is they connect with magne@@ ts .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
the not@@ ded notes have the function of the letters a scri@@ pt .
and this ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , really changed my life .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x have killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
at the last ted conference , i gave a ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
the modern industrial world as we know it , is har@@ ely 300 years old .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and i ask , how sk@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ stic ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
i looked in the ra@@ cks , and it was a little bit p@@ ink .
this is a fish el@@ ev@@ fish in the sou@@ th@@ th@@ corner spa@@ in .
and then we worked out a co@@ de-@@ of-@@ condu@@ ct .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said to , in this particular clay .
some of my cl@@ ou@@ ses have happened over the last five years .
then these connected influ@@ ences of pre-@@ industrial cultures .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed photos should have the same perspective .
so the dra@@ matic high numbers come in the prison in@@ mates .
what context is that about the thought and feelings about yourself ?
now , what does this have to do with plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
but nothing was invented that would let me go back , so far .
a kid in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
so this is just an app@@ lic@@ ation of many you can do with this .
this is my w@@ eless wa@@ age . a very simple thing .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
5@@ 4 percent of dea@@ ths happened through dri@@ ll@@ ing .
that means you navi@@ gate over sound and rhyth@@ m .
this actually inclu@@ des a period of two / half weeks .
if someone lies , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
so all these green areas , these are the most environments .
we &apos;re developing to collabor@@ ative thinking , heart beings .
even if you were to sho@@ ot yourself now , you would have emissions .
and this is called and@@ sting re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
do you know a 3@@ 3,000 0,000 in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
so i off@@ ered a $ 10,000 price of software for the w@@ ers .
and the cru@@ cial indi@@ c@@ ator of for this , is the extin@@ ction of languages .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to go into the future .
most of you know most people know this from the software area .
these people will be connected to the film in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty -- forever .
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists that there is not this test .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about gene@@ tically changed food .
and so i think the ted community should be bra@@ wers .
you learn how to find the notes on the instrument .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph@@ .@@ d. student .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check .
i think in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
well , finally , the film got a very big moment@@ um .
and it has spread , organic , of course .
it &apos;s in the present right now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
there was no piano at the piano at the moment as an instrument .
we find some od@@ ties about what their rights are .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful .
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
if you could only have one , it would be a very different world .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you &apos;ve got to go into the house .
it &apos;s about creating ab@@ g@@ ging of goods .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ be@@ ta@@ ster te@@ there on the bottom right .
i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
and somehow , we have to create changes that can bring this down to zero .
this is the period of most of the per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
and as i listen@@ ed to her , she made her coo@@ k@@ ie sounds .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be again oper@@ able .
and that &apos;s why when we think about it we have an interesting situation before us .
if you could do it for those , you could help me .
and just like that all these companies disappe@@ ared one at the other .
if we actually don &apos;t pick any phosp@@ hor@@ us and give it .
so if we do something about cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and i was good , i gradu@@ ated with c@@ um lau@@ de .
people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of these wonder@@ s .
we distribu@@ ted li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its of children , and you can play with it .
but on youtube , more than 4@@ 8 hours of video a minute .
speci@@ alized skills and skills and their combin@@ ation leads to success .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
i played the first sentence by bee@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ o@@ lin conc@@ ert .
l@@ oud and sig@@ ns , f and b , etc .
man is supposed to have from the mon@@ key or a common st@@ or .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i like a lot of black colors , gra@@ y notes and stuff like stuff .
what were his circum@@ stances of life , like the society and the politics ?
on september 10@@ th of le@@ last year , the machine went on for the first time .
i don &apos;t want to give a like to a fish the same rights as a being .
and what i learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely inevi@@ table .
i love this : wat@@ wat@@ son forces human ene@@ my . &quot;
that &apos;s what we want to use a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
three months moved three months later , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure went on .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with it .
and this is something we need to learn very quickly .
this is the more you kill , the better .
people said , don &apos;t you be afraid to never succe@@ ed ?
this is all reality today , and in the future will be much more possible .
so playing en@@ ables the growing of ties , trust and each other .
i think , in mass mass car@@ cer@@ ations have fundament@@ ally changed our world .
she said , &quot; this will make you very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually ec@@ ute the experiments .
i got ed in the car , i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
in the short period of time here , one realized : ted has an identity .
so unfortunately , unfortunately , god have lost to virtu@@ zing a piece of lost conversation .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back .
8 8 the tsun@@ ic war@@ ning . speak@@ er 9 : cyber@@ attac@@ ks .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
&quot; do you remember the patient you sen@@ home ? &quot;
just tra@@ tend building a@@ part@@ ments against the cities .
just if it seems har@@ dly appropriate , perhaps play is the most necessary .
there &apos;s now all this ru@@ m@@ l in front of the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ation .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be possibly little bad .
nam@@ to to lie a way way that you can just apply this lo@@ gic .
we live on a planet covered 70 percent with water .
often , the music class is that you just learn to read the notes .
because that would just the letters you learned to paint .
and i tend to think of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence as my sha@@ do@@ ws .
because a good engineer built either great cars or nuclear power plants .
it comes naturally from asia , in the tra@@ p from japan .
you r@@ r@@ ented tele@@ phone . you didn &apos;t buy it . you &apos;d buying it .
offi@@ cial belie@@ belief of all western industri@@ alized societies .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
there &apos;s what enormous speed speed there there .
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
we should be able to ro@@ everything want .
you can only have zer@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions if you &apos;re not there .
studies have been done to see if that was .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any government technology does .
so that was the very first beginning of its own musical expression .
they say that you never those those never die .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to hold them apart .
but when i ask you , how are you with your wife ?
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how is it going to get us ?
you &apos;re colle@@ cting the piece about the piece in the secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
what you need is an environment that they &apos;re able to do it .
but what if the image conne@@ cts you to all your images ?
and as i say the word of justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is gone .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of an@@ atom@@ y .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and star@@ ing at me .
big data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world .
it &apos;s a re@@ al-@@ time 3d 3d scan and a motion image .
it &apos;s something we work for the olymp@@ ics in london .
you &apos;re agree with him fre@@ to sna@@ ke him when it s@@ no@@ ps .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se defen@@ se before something gets into the body .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there now , and you can all be enga@@ ged .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
now why am i going to from my audience that it &apos;s also ac@@ ac@@ heard ?
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ es , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
if you do a re@@ con@@ cu@@ tion tion and never make the mistake again .
listen consci@@ ously , and say it ta@@ stes you or not .
and not the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice it .
because it &apos;s calling a up that has been lost in a a way .
to keep ambi@@ ins , right with the com@@ pos@@ er .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
how good , you think , are you about dealing with the decisions ?
we can actually nutri@@ nutri@@ ents back in agriculture in this way .
he ended all whole thought , and he did something completely new .
beyond the simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ it is actually quite powerful .
and this is one of the three major sources of the exi@@ sting online problems today .
when we look , we got into all sorts of in@@ conven@@ i@@ areas .
it was the foot@@ ball world c@@ up as it@@ al@@ y .
if i &apos;m not right , the can@@ z@@ ler is not a man .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we tell stories .
and that fir@@ es in the words of open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
and you &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
we can better deal with more categ@@ ories than we have more choices .
essential tool for information exploration has been since every stories .
they knew all the bits and by@@ tes that they had to attack .
okay . so anyone who &apos;s willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s off@@ ering .
you basically basically learning how read read it before you just speak one word .
we now know nine cities planning to use this ap@@ p .
a de@@ ception becomes something because somebody sees it like this .
br@@ y@@ an , they really brought a string string here .
sometimes these ideas are h ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paraly@@ sis . and you know what ?
and it was much worse for a than it in memory .
the future is here . wind , wind , sun and a new energy system .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it brought images and text together and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
all the par@@ ties , all the fra@@ ctions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
be still to be your contribu@@ tion to whatever he wants to be .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ from the cam@@ als came from the rest of the world .
they &apos;re creating an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
and the sugge@@ pos@@ al was to build a lot more coal fac@@ tor@@ ies .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
the reason for this : the government could track back where a text came from .
so how are we going to oper@@ ate the question of the characteri@@ stics of character ?
and this app@@ s let us use our hands to improve our communities .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ ig@@ al . i design computer games .
and today we all feel as ow@@ ner of our pop culture .
i wrote wrote up four words and i want to explain for a second .
and not like a tech company , but like the internet itself .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain myself .
and we became a right family for a four@@ four and a half years to a right family .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
but this picture is actually completely com@@ posed , from photos of different places .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a talk at ted@@ global .
i don &apos;t need to say , vac@@ cin@@ es es are essential .
you see the the of of letters when you can get the language .
and i think it &apos;s out with a medical person , and that &apos;s me .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and this is a thought i think is appropriate .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next satur@@ day .
we know something about what determin@@ es the happiness of happiness self .
today we can pro@@ out to do@@ zens of companies that have done exactly this .
to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds .
if your work fle@@ w -- it wasn not entirely your mistake , right ?
i said , &quot; don , what for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies from fri@@ day at youtube .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the the worst spi@@ ho@@ ages of humanity .
and who &apos;s explor@@ ing that this is particularly true in men .
but now not at the local level , but at a global scale .
photos where you have to take a moment to find out the trick .
and they can do that because they connect cause and cor@@ relation .
&quot; do you remember the patient with rich@@ patients ? &quot;
by 20@@ 20 , we go from two to five billion internet users .
it &apos;s people who believe that as individuals can change the world .
interpre@@ ted are trans@@ lation of the written notes in clinical music .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure park .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the cha@@ ir@@ man of our country ! &quot;
my story begins right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
writing writing books is my prof@@ ession , but of course , it &apos;s more than that .
and if i &apos;m right , the can@@ z@@ ler is a man .
we type , we pass in , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
this shows the enor@@ m@@ ously of role that play a marine prote@@ cted area .
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire@@ man .
because when the water moves out , it dro@@ ps in the atlan@@ tic .
and the most important thing about this is to look at at the ground , first of all .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : you . . seen .
we think we &apos;re not as good as reality as playing .
and then du@@ mp@@ les st@@ ones up so he s@@ im@@ ess them the vision .
and at end , they just want to get the poor rema@@ ins .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and carry the nutri@@ ents .
now this is a three-@@ sentence that descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what &apos;s it going to get us ?
this qu@@ est took me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me .
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was just for experts .
and they developed great app@@ s , working with urban collabor@@ f .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
and that &apos;s the core concern@@ cause of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
a nuclear re@@ actor that provi@@ des itself a solution to the tr@@ ash .
whether the music is whi@@ to them or too swe@@ et .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
he challen@@ ged oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his star@@ ust .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says un@@ moving objects feel the same .
it shows un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented , what happens if governments attack their own citizens .
you might think that he was fin@@ ing , but that &apos;s not true .
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out with this .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
if we predict , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately the skep@@ tics live in very different cam@@ ps .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a short phone call , go to toi@@ let .
this is , of course , is high-@@ tech agriculture , but the facili@@ ts carry themselves .
mor@@ e@@ over , t@@ &apos;s &apos;s mother today is in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
the united states today have the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
there are 6@@ 8 million people sitting esti@@ ma@@ ted around the world in the wheel@@ chair .
did anybody see the movie &quot; bu@@ de@@ ving b@@ bell ? &quot;
so it &apos;s more cap@@ turing an idea than really a moment .
in order to ada@@ pt to an in@@ const@@ ant world , we need to play .
this food ad@@ for@@ u@@ ment of 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
so ham@@ mer heads are the sequ@@ el of my piano .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you brie@@ fly a single , bor@@ ing slide .
we love to jump in lying . we love that .
this is a portra@@ it of photograph@@ er phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
these are the questions we have to deal with for the next 50 years .
nasa has a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but this &apos;s a lot of non-@@ profit transpor@@ ts going on and complicated things .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to my friends , to human beings .
you connect it to a particular note , and then you tend it to place .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different metho@@ ds .
now , this is three weeks , and this is one and a half hours .
it &apos;s not poli@@ tically active ; that is bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see here .
if we go back from there , what would 20 evidence look like ?
so every paraly@@ zed can actually communicate or draw with their eyes alone .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you do a computer chip .
now , how do we laun@@ ch a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
then we have to break down mu@@ st-@@ run capacity on the net .
but great forces with fac@@ -@@ tional temporary sig@@ ns to each other .
of course , my grandmother would all their grand@@ children say they &apos;re something special .
and from here , i can go into the side and call them back .
the kni@@ fe that you can study ; my hand that you can study .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , will con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
all cultures have been involved ating again over again in the dance of new living opportunities .
this is &quot; the ab@@ and@@ ed , in the national gi@@ aller@@ a .
now this is basic al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s go through it .
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
and just like this , the ic@@ e@@ berg you another side of its person@@ ality .
finally , i ste@@ pped out of my car , and i went up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court .
because the frank@@ fur@@ facili@@ ty could best best re@@ ct the phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds have already been repor@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
i really think it , and no , that &apos;s not a wonder thinking .
end are very very , very important , and in this case , the end domin@@ ated the end .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you put your fish ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a really large picture of this this piece of the metal .
and the answer is until we get to zero , the temperature will continue .
they also had to regi@@ ster a piece of un@@ ce@@ ce@@ ented text from this ty@@ pe@@ writer .
you might know this , i have over 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
today , more than ever before , a little hon@@ est@@ y brings us very far far .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a syn@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary at the time .
this &apos;s just to see if you step back and look at the whole thing .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it bur@@ ns for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic pla@@ board coming to the same .
so we decided to do tony -- temp@@ t -- and to support his cause .
these fantastic game controll@@ ers of these , , there were she@@ ep &apos; c@@ es .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life .
so we can now jump and look at all the ted prize w@@ inner .
from a point of the of her@@ he ved self , b had a worse time .
and so i want to show you what else might show you a little surprise might be .
a piece of art you never look at has no power to work .
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed everything , knowledge , and it makes it acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet .
and that that every cre@@ being uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
fan@@ tas@@ y@@ books have always had maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gues in iran iran are divi@@ ded into 15 so-@@ called levels .
you could try to exp@@ and the capacity of the exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
which comes to , of course , is extremely se , and it &apos;s a computer game .
another more bright , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper in a moment .
she said , &quot; honor ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
we have two creatures , both of the mi@@ d-@@ 197@@ 9 , exactly the same day .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at this on the time scale of the earth &apos;s time .
and even when he walked out the door , he showed his ra@@ ck .
it has to do with going back to the 10@@ 10 century .
such a little bu@@ b , who &apos;s not interested in the fire tri@@ a@@ do@@ s .
and it goes to nine billion . moving to nine billion .
every american has about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
the first sentence is , there &apos;s very cla@@ es , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
the ur@@ an is used gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
so i want to show you what we found in my institute .
because in fact , we have to have to see if there &apos;s the sou@@ l or not .
different speak@@ ers : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
the sou@@ l is such of ritual , says about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
have you ever heard of this from over@@ population problems ?
i remember seeing a child playing on a th@@ res@@ hold .
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
if you te@@ ar ar that somewhere , it takes take while to take it .
imagine a big explosion as you &apos;re ris@@ ing up to 1,000 meters .
100 percent clean electricity over the next 10 years .
there &apos;s be there be a whole lot of resi@@ stance and argu@@ ments .
and he said , &quot; well , you could bar@@ ely remember me .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , vision .
so the alli@@ ance for climate change has started two campaig@@ ns .
oil is a problem , and coal is the the biggest problem .
you probably even knew the size of the machine .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; con@@ stra@@ in@@ ed . &quot;
it &apos;s not about pus@@ hing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
he ti@@ es &quot; mar@@ yl@@ pi@@ al &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and this gave us great confidence of what we studied at .
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i got these expedi@@ tions .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
so the next day , i called up , just before the event , don don .
a lo@@ ned journalist had been talked about this fish for a long time .
you don &apos;t need to make music if it gets you bor@@ ing .
if you throw the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
what does influ@@ have to our thinking and how our memory ?
in the ground , over six percent of the carbon is stor@@ ed .
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in the form of a species ?
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
so sex games are distribu@@ ted , they &apos;re both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans .
out@@ lay med up on the des@@ and@@ gent picture of nasa .
these were care@@ ful people , ated people , de@@ ant people .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . it starts with the animal beginn@@ cher .
but you can also think differently depen@@ ding on how we see our identity .
they don &apos;t exist in a system based on sun@@ light , how we do that .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve government citi@@ zen@@ ship .
this is a slide that i happened to cho@@ se out of my fol@@ der .
we make in brazil agriculture in where we re@@ gain nutri@@ ents .
in fact , sometimes he can feel really par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
we developed the game super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute for the future .
how would your consciousness deal with your body being oc@@ alized in the room ?
they &apos;re caus@@ the kind like a water cur@@ cur@@ ence with ging points of water .
all of this affec@@ ts me and all of this also affec@@ ts my experience with the com@@ position .
and one night , there &apos;s a p@@ at on its hotel door .
so if you basically about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
she was something that did that you always wanted to be near her .
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c there &apos;s a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ban@@ s .
i say , ul@@ f , what do you need big car car ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
it &apos;s easy to check that it has very different in mind .
many people use the word , but they don &apos;t even know what it means means en detail .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement you can do about your life &apos;s work .
so why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from top to a to b ?
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
and we bring them back in a con@@ temporary story for kids .
there are effects that you can transform live , such like hall and fil@@ ters .
and it worked for for a while until i met prin@@ ter .
who can make a fish taste so good after it coo@@ ked ?
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or does in the connection machine .
why is it impossible in play , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
now in practice , people are not te@@ sted on their chromo@@ som@@ es .
it turns out he had a stre@@ p@@ to@@ king infe@@ ction .
but if you se@@ at , most drin@@ king water will fall away .
why didn &apos;t i ask the th@@ ie@@ er ? why did i send her home ?
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- love to play their lifetime .
but think in a way that is integr@@ ated into our own life .
i was ama@@ king , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
she looks at him , and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- lu@@ ck@@ ily , lu@@ ck@@ ily .
go from the little bit choices to the many , then you stay there .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate your child to paraly@@ sis . no &apos;s no .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that should work .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically your own world .
the perman@@ ent report today today with music is not pro@@ mot@@ able .
the pilot had already the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
i take something that is obviously a de@@ ception , and i make it look real .
he said , &quot; no . they &apos;re doing it because the food is better . &quot;
they weren &apos;t e@@ aten ; they thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
so a big li@@ on full , that &apos;s how we wel@@ come the risk .
it &apos;s not sc@@ ar@@ city , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , we &apos;re enjo@@ y@@ ers . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
so isn &apos;t it interesting high high competition have a strong effect ?
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ju@@ ine ine .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china , and the third one is in prepar@@ ation .
does it allow chemistry to create these really big molecules made before ?
but the spa@@ tial order of images is actually important here .
so i can zo@@ om into my tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory in a certain frame of time .
that meant that during the chinese invasi@@ on , he was inst@@ antly killed .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my upp@@ ie@@ f , he was very loved .
don you you afraid that the hu@@ mili@@ ation of a agre@@ ement ?
in other words , every step here cor@@ respon@@ ds to a poten@@ cy in the performance scale .
then the next generation , where we &apos;re actually really mar@@ ily today .
or &quot; how was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something .
you can only be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life .
it just developed a ro@@ ta@@ ral v@@ acc@@ ine with other people .
another citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen but the government was playing a central role here .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were pen@@ da@@ ers and in ja@@ il .
and i can sort of , re@@ back everything i &apos;ve looked at i &apos;ve been so today .
so they get audi@@ ble , which they &apos;ve came up of in the mind .
temp@@ ace was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
you can see it in a moment , but you can also see away if you want .
now i can all answer your questions and give you an extraordinary so@@ cket .
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ american in this country it was a time of ter@@ ror .
to really close , you can go to the cra@@ cks .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
you know how un@@ comfortable it it like to be in a full el@@ ev@@ ator ?
if you want to know , these other spi@@ kes are also in fri@@ days .
and then i took a ju@@ ner@@ on pen@@ der and i ho@@ ched up to it .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand about classi@@ cal music .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known under the pri@@ mates .
they &apos;re pre@@ designed to be light , sound , motor and sen@@ sor .
and we can turn out in milli@@ seconds with this big battery .
and cru@@ cial about this study was that the teachers were not pro@@ ven .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , sharing communities and the un@@ expected .
we &apos;ve got 3@@ gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany today .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s in virg@@ ini@@ a as sla@@ ves .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
what are the scri@@ p@@ can he@@ have to write write which which &apos;s sting to of ?
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ze@@ politi@@ politicians , said once .
because you do that that called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain bear .
i left ti@@ des , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
this is that to two billion years of labor experience .
over time , there &apos;s not fish left and we think that &apos;s the standard le .
you can see in the upp@@ er field that his chromo@@ some just fall@@ ing apart .
and you can do that through those metho@@ ds , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
this is actually a poster of not@@ cy lady that was really recor@@ ded .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
because this , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
lights , sound , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
if you &apos;re growing more wind to each other , the system starts to fail .
it &apos;s a hum@@ m@@ y-@@ d@@ h who has fear in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
the basis of a lot of technologies are technologies , and these are growing ex@@ poten@@ tially .
in these recor@@ ds , there was a fol@@ der called fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
here &apos;s the state of the whole demon@@ stration that i &apos;ve been to this way .
because they &apos;s talking about energy , but no one &apos;s talking talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
so part of it with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so they put these places places there .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discus@@ sing .
we do this in china , for example , where we take right waste of it .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
he &apos;s a beautiful sp@@ very ce in front of d@@ ressed sho@@ w@@ girl .
it turned out that he just wanted to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ers .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ os say it .
so this allows us to work again as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the mes@@ fe trick .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
every single harvard employees now auto@@ matically participa@@ te in a life@@ -@@ fund .
as a interpre@@ ter a piece of music , i only have the written written notes .
a chromo@@ some is just a piece of in@@ cted chemical material .
he had a poten@@ tially vi@@ tal disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
well , today , for first first , our environment starts to respond to us .
right now , in this world , we think data is a cur@@ se .
we need to face the consequences , and we better start pre@@ p@@ are ourselves .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it right right . &quot;
he asked me what the introdu@@ ction of these p was for me .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
democracy grew up in , but at the same time science also grew in .
and i promis@@ ed coming back to tell you how the machine works .
and with each trial , the kids get immedi@@ ate feedback that works and what doesn &apos;t work .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
so i say , in my own words , what be written between this sc@@ aff@@ old .
we do that . as ration@@ ally as we are , as much as we value intelle@@ ct .
so films were the way to bring ge images and stories . that fit together .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
how can i teach you my mistakes so they don &apos;t do the same ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the bran@@ ch .
this &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel !
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
they had sold this 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s program to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data why not content content ?
because at one point , i had to say to myself , &quot; what am i actually doing here ?
and we got the mission to design a building building to the exp@@ o .
but the king of si@@ am got al@@ umin@@ um bri@@ ck .
and players are always willing to work hard if you &apos;re getting the right task .
everybody has four different vari@@ ations ; you can choose which use .
this is not an electr@@ on microscop@@ e , it &apos;s a regular regular microscop@@ image .
and so in 198@@ 2 , span@@ ish company with environmental consciousness bought the country .
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
and i &apos;m sc@@ ared a lot more that that one would in@@ qui@@ re .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds in this place .
and after two , three days , it realized that she would never wa@@ ard again .
we were only five people at the time time to re@@ build society .
here you need a lo@@ gic , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
co2 war@@ ms the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of rever@@ ge@@ al er@@ r@@ ors .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;ll get about what &apos;s bad about it .
and then it goes back to wards , and then it &apos;s actually only seen .
that &apos;s the equivalent to a hundred nuclear power plants , because this &apos;s going very dly everywhere .
so we &apos;re there to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be a little bad .
this map gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and ser@@ ves for ori@@ entation in the rest of the book .
and they &apos;ve prepared with that , in a really wonderful way way for the future civil rights movement .
you can also try this in words like re@@ ven@@ or w@@ w@@ ction or something like that .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing .
he was a to@@ dd@@ ler , and he was not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
in your mind , ti@@ mel@@ ine and prob@@ ability ability of really anything anything to life ?
they come from ideas that are driven by per@@ su@@ asi@@ on in our he@@ arts .
i &apos;m not a doctor or resear@@ cher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the importance of our actions have in the histor@@ ical context .
but even even in my mouth , sometimes i &apos;ve fra@@ pped this thing .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
and these two worl@@ ds are p up each other , new and old thinking .
this is this lo@@ gic in this one , yes , in this illusion talk , the expression .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new opportunities for leaders .
tradition@@ ally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many in the world .
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do you . just do . &quot;
and now our fo@@ ei@@ tive consciousness immediately , you can do something out of it .
but always , the the approach that it should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
it &apos;s something that is not material , material nature .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting yp@@ types ?
whereas the language was or@@ dered by under@@ dered ran@@ g .
i often wonder you often forget something more fundamental .
it &apos;s evolved over evolution to look at ine@@ amin@@ ants . &quot;
this is a highly important non-@@ profit categ@@ ori@@ ti@@ a .
you study the works that he com@@ posed before and after .
it thre@@ ed blue blue because of the genes we had put ed .
there are some innova@@ tions in the nuclear area ; mod@@ ular , liquid .
well , they couldn &apos;t make the work , not econom@@ ically .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her lives .
a project i started recently was to build a gene gun .
when i start with the simple , i learn how i choose .
they grew tra@@ t@@ meat bee@@ ds on which , which were essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
but at citizens , it is all public so everyone can see it .
if you think you look good at something , it &apos;s almost safe like that .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
it was also the starting point of many dis@@ pu@@ tes in our family .
so i can take a step back and jump right to a specific se@@ ction .
now , all our objects , our environment , start talking back to us .
and she believed that these were the top@@ ics that we had to take care of .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most most popular wiki@@ pe@@ as@@ te .
there are still six hundred trees in the ama@@ zon alone .
no fear , no source , child paraly@@ sis , pu@@ ff .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks it &apos;s going worse and worse in the world .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the buy a car .
until the &apos; 8@@ 0s , it was fis@@ hed in a big style .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , climate crisis .
but when it comes out to be imple@@ mented , something changes .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy nobody nobody anything .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that impro@@ ves government &apos;s work .
i &apos;m talking about race , and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both clu@@ sive or anything .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i did not just kill the out@@ standing with the spe@@ ar .
. you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft .
four times as many in the last 30 years as previous 75 .
and more than anything , are you the best parents they can only be ?
and so i brought you a project that i want to introdu@@ ce you .
that means you can see on the internet how to re@@ the nutri@@ ents back .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty simple to itself .
i had something , your sister had something . go , drink a be@@ er . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away an@@ atom@@ y very distance .
and that &apos;s the reason why , for example , ability is ws to antibio@@ tics .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number of multi@@ pli@@ ly .
now , the memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories .
and that illu@@ strated these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
and often we just ran into a dead gas and had to re@@ collect us .
so what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
with your chem@@ ist block , john -- how are you doing with that ?
we can give a new meaning to going out beyond heavy times .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could evidence or dis@@ prove .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is it &apos;s a growing library .
we told their stories , and we assu@@ red her we were still with her .
imagine everybody can give a little don@@ ation to a image .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ ul@@ es , which have a specific function .
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the greatest cap@@ abilities .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
but it didn &apos;t need to describe the big objects around us .
as a sequence , the body develop@@ ves more of the typical female course .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
no gl@@ ame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
these people represent several trillion dollars that going to flow into the global economy .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , drin@@ king something . &quot;
i looked through the stupid wall and saw her standing on the other side .
and someone who has such an arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ns so much more .
bin laden death takes an increas@@ ed risk risk .
now , i had a unique place that day ; i sat on 1@@ d .
that &apos;s me how i do this in &quot; &quot; i &apos;m bad &quot; face .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because over again , i read out something new .
ad@@ oles@@ ties are for a change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted to yet .
this is across our country of the second largest river of america .
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still thro@@ wing away every day , still sta@@ ying there .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative stuff .
because they &apos;ve been t@@ ching the cha@@ ir@@ man twice .
so the music works for for me as much as the spo@@ ken language .
not as i do -- i &apos;ll games , i &apos;m a little bit tran@@ on@@ y .
i want to start with what offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
and suddenly have a interface , which is much more intui@@ tive and much more natural .
you can see in the middle of the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ , ti@@ ver of the flow .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as e@@ h and ever .
so the baby is carbon positive for all life , from the beginning .
okay , just a quick example of a version of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
we need to find ways to face these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
and if we learn knowledge , maybe we can re@@ f@@ used out of it .
so he did what every good develop@@ er would do , and he wrote an ap@@ p .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
he said , &quot; tell me what is fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
so we can use the genetic code writing our words , sent@@ ences , thought .
i got close , and i slowly notice that these kids actually beat a low .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always ye@@ ar@@ ning for more creativity .
we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se br@@ ands for our experiment .
there &apos;s actually two concep@@ ts of happiness we can use , one per self .
and now i &apos;m conne@@ cting the fil@@ ters still with the b@@ ass , a little more expression .
you would call , in engineering teams , call a re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
we &apos;ve ar ar from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ment .
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutri@@ ents back .
form law of ne@@ ar@@ by , shape law of continu@@ ity and so on .
he came to the table with a bright , almost glo@@ wing white color .
chri@@ sti@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism or whatever .
the united states is one of the two more pollution , together with china .
don don , i said , &quot; what for example is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
while a ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i brea@@ the its ti@@ time atmosphere .
because steve jobs once you you need to dig so@@ to understand how works .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother suggest@@ beat her .
this is a generation that grew up with this to see your voice for gran@@ ted .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destro@@ destro@@ at the same time .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ at today , off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
three have always gone of the l@@ l@@ es , two are always wa@@ ited .
basically , the bottom of the sea came on de@@ ck and then thro@@ wn back .
but if i could give that and i could make them through safe , i would do it .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the con@@ go ur@@ val forest .
it for about 12 percent of your decisions , it it them an hour or more of your time .
here we see , fil@@ film , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ die ...
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be du@@ m@@ b as a trees .
and most people understand that but they think one is the other &apos;s input .
they use online attac@@ ks to ear@@ n a lot of money , a huge pi@@ le of money .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
a million people sp@@ out la@@ tin america a year and migra@@ te to the united states .
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa island on the a@@ z@@ ors .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
this was then dis@@ ved by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back ; they go forward .
and they realized that the city never got this hy@@ dr@@ ant free .
and that radi@@ cally changes the interaction that we have out with our environment .
this is the w@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ st@@ sin from tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is the can@@ nel su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ west green@@ land .
should i mar@@ ry later ? should i have kids , or should i make a career ? &quot;
it &apos;s a story with a obvious end , and he can decide how to evol@@ ve .
if you take cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re even more effective than the p@@ ills of every shape .
okay , there are reasons reasons , and i think what reasons these are .
but is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a hard thing about me ?
12 to 24 hours later , it all came together as the as it was .
all right , there &apos;s the front pre@@ st@@ o , that is a quick piece .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to take a few decades .
and the perspective of your team is more important than any l@@ or@@ be@@ ers in the world .
i think my personal view is very simple expla@@ ined with this slide and access .
so despite that war@@ ning , i knew anyone would buy business rights .
it &apos;s not gener@@ a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but it &apos;s the resol@@ ution of reality .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
she particularly li@@ to like him in , , because he has a tenden@@ lt to the ri@@ cer@@ ty .
but the na@@ tive americans say , &quot; the plant is ks to us . &quot;
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bis@@ ho@@ s@@ ary of wor@@ che@@ ster .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate all of this again .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s being driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
in the spirit of the other self , the memory of self , you get a different story .
they were playing cu@@ games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
there are these ancient cu@@ bes , there &apos;s she@@ ep pat@@ cks . you know ?
so we have the eyes in the front , and now you think we see from the front to the back .
and it does it par@@ tly with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even really understand .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all le@@ th@@ ing deli@@ ies don not end with a ar@@ cer@@ ation .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success in 10,000 hours .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes from the healthy and rhyth@@ m from the dance .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster do you are ?
the brown n is sort of the conven@@ tional system , the green one is our system .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental consciousness in the south .
so the big question is , &quot; what are player ster@@ ically good ? &quot;
if you ask about the happiness of memory , it &apos;s a very different thing .
these are decisions that need to hand@@ le your grand@@ children children , or their grand@@ children , they need to deal le .
our vo@@ cal ch@@ ch@@ ds to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
i worked in the collective , which was bas@@ is@@ democra@@ tic .
so i &apos;m into shape much much more ently than behavior than that .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted of get closer to matter , like that .
i think if you keep people off it , you &apos;ll get them closer to failure .
you really want to make the decision cor@@ rec@@ tly if it &apos;s for all the e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
i allowed li@@ l@@ ly asking me if i could mention them .
now -- we can just ski@@ p that -- i &apos;m just going to ski@@ p the video instead ...
and i might want to introdu@@ ce my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
in the and@@ cks , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the drin@@ king water source for this city .
what you might ask is , how does this come ? why ? what about those ?
now , before we started today , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and and you also have to do it and understand it to make it to it and understand .
and i thought , and i said , &quot; yeah , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
and what are our values , and what are what &apos;s our tar@@ ment , our basis ?
and finally , i get programs that can sort perfectly .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it &apos;s been a lot of work in febru@@ ary .
but that &apos;s actually not what this is all about , and then i open my hand .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in final loo@@ p .
now when i use the term &quot; wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
it &apos;t not happening in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be the che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be beautiful .
in fact , you &apos;d have to prove if there is such a freedom of will@@ .
our ancestors had never had that hard to fight with the question of when someone was dead .
because the set was an accu@@ rate copy of the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
when they came in 100 ways , dam@@ n , one of them should have been perfect .
oh , you know that . ok . prime . so we have some players here .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to ra@@ th@@ user .
you can then explain that much better , there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
you bring a new idea in it , and in a same , it &apos;s ans@@ wer@@ ed with a reaction .
nobody knew where the next life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to find at that moment .
and if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- the question is .
and now just just a little bit through my skin and on the other side out like this .
these little oil dro@@ p@@ let , in sense were the most primi@@ tive cell form .
now i want to take this idea a little bit further with what &apos;s a little crazy .
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics on the net .
there on de@@ po@@ nia , but otherwise in the landscape , right ?
if the er@@ ror happens , the student gets up the next difficult piece .
i represent these kids who were con@@ vi@@ cted to very hard pun@@ ish@@ ment .
we imagine imagine epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies , and we give people the ways the opportunities to reach them .
and then , the next day you would play play , and the next day you would eat .
this number ris@@ es , and it goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing .
if somebody takes something they doesn &apos;t hear them , they not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
they &apos;re talking about what they &apos;re about what &apos;s going to look like , they s@@ ra@@ gs around power .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ima@@ points ? &quot;
they say who has no sou@@ l , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
so the second sentence is if if &apos;s right , it has no sou@@ l .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular about wikipedia .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on one strength , rather on both .
just like &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , it it seems to have come out no@@ nothing .
and in fact , this wrong sing data of stu@@ x@@ net is already taken .
the rest of the day , the ev@@ ening , i had this na@@ ging feeling in my sto@@ mach .
it would be thou@@ d@@ ately of us to consci@@ and a@@ ted people . &quot;
they can make them less easily , yes , or even to fall .
man 5 : brand is cut al@@ co@@ hol hol scri@@ ber@@ ling .
or what i imagine today because what you might think .
evolution privi@@ le@@ ged the creatures that ada@@ pt to their environment .
i know they did that because half of the americans do this every day .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i was left .
and i would be happy if ce@@ g could help do this .
this is the pressure and and print scri@@ pe@@ pt with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
imagine the first piece : a man who bur@@ ns his life &apos;s work .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , was about this guy .
i said , &quot; how much percent is chicken ? &quot;
these are real patients under@@ through pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
seven million people are dis@@ ab@@ oned on cur@@ ren@@ cy or with condi@@ tional ex@@ pos@@ ation .
we &apos;re not playing the production costs right now , no gl@@ ame .
so , okay , to ha@@ ck biology , you need kind of material .
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i decide to be happy .
why do we need to prevent people from knowing something if it &apos;s true ?
it &apos;s about what we think about the people with these words .
we &apos;re pus@@ hing pri@@ mar@@ ily to the boundar@@ ies of biological reality and to those of our imagination .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is also the survival of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
fro@@ sty the carbon is a pleasure , happy fellow .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically possible .
the other place that was very interested in urban ism is sing@@ apo@@ re .
we &apos;re close to the seas@@ onal , and we &apos;re moving to the world cham@@ on@@ ship .
last month , researchers last month that entire continent now has a negative ice foot@@ print .
no important under@@ dea@@ vor , dem@@ and@@ ed innovation has ever ever taken without risk .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number at 100,000 .
so i want to share with you three things i &apos;ve learned about myself that day .
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ p@@ pe@@ stage are you right now ?
i had it better . all that sele@@ ction allowed me to have better .
this is i think they are in there are fewer people than actually exist .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to have to over@@ come an oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
what na@@ than@@ iel did , music brought him back to a community of friends .
that &apos;s hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good follo@@ ver for marketing . &quot;
the bu@@ ri@@ an es@@ el is an es@@ el made of p@@ ure nature .
and with a kind of flas@@ h@@ light , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the continu@@ state of humanity .
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a stupid mistake ?
i could see it in your eyes , there was sc@@ ary , life was .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the ele@@ ction to have more men than women are .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where we been ban@@ ned foreign adverti@@ sing .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft &apos;s research . a very good collaboration .
and you know the la@@ d@@ der about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
con@@ struc@@ tors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an i@@ ter@@ a@@ ative process .
this father of this young man was identi@@ fied as a tag of the pan@@ te lam@@ a .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you ask this crazy crazy sign@@ ct ? &quot;
it &apos;s because of what 17@@ 7@@ 6 to the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
these wir@@ es run 13@@ thousand thousand traffic as the machine runs to performance .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts two different technologies .
16 ter@@ a@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy boun@@ ped every 8@@ 8 minutes on the surface of the earth .
con@@ cre@@ te building blocks very quickly became the most used building unit in the world .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we consu@@ me as we are in the world .
think of this as the sequ@@ el of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ers on virtual earth .
he looked at me like i just had a a by whit@@ ney hou@@ ston .
they don &apos;t have right to their own facts . &quot; gu@@ il@@ t , they don &apos;t have them .
the next generation of graphic user spaces works a lot more with behavior .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the state center ...
and then we did that , and then we were able to get a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
i negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i looked for new gro@@ ks .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did after that .
he said , &quot; om@@ a tells all the grand@@ grand@@ children that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and this is his room .
it can save the lives of 4@@ ,@@ 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
that probably very good to that science fi@@ ction role .
so with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficient cies in the system .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical diagra@@ m by age .
under@@ pants for exactly one week are all i did in my su@@ it@@ case .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our water has no ine@@ amin@@ ties . &quot;
but now for the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
if you move it , go back the diseases , horri@@ ble disease , and that &apos;s happening right now .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wor@@ e a little tox@@ in bottle .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
in israel , they say , if you save a human life , you save the earth .
mu@@ st-@@ run is simply , the power plant runs to keep the frequ@@ ency .
we then built a team , a great team , and we started with this .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on the area of human possibilities .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they run .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good at something you probably have right .
he makes a stat@@ ement about living in life right now , and maybe even doing about things slowly .
there are distin@@ on fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where i actually need to reach .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ lo@@ blocks .
you can put a switch in between , and so they created a little thi@@ mmer .
these organisms can be totally dry ated , they can actually live in the vac@@ u@@ um .
are you something that is a little bit more quie@@ t , reser@@ ves , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
the work of the interpre@@ starts sort much like a theater theater class .
it ta@@ swe@@ et and po@@ ure like you would take a bi@@ te from the ocean .
and i fly through a little robo@@ tic experience through the hall@@ ars of the ship .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
on the left , you see the image points , the different in@@ on@@ ts impres@@ sions .
we want to put every single interaction in the world into a useful stone .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same thing .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
so you have to du@@ p out the i@@ pad and leave out the fire@@ flies .
i said yes , you need about the same as as spo@@ ken language .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be divi@@ ded into two hal@@ ves .
we &apos;re talking ir@@ on@@ ically , we small indi@@ leadership about it , &quot; progress . &quot;
of course , the ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i answer , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you like it or not .
he saw again through the window , and he could hear all the to@@ hu@@ abo@@ h@@ u .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to conne@@ cting the world and technology .
spa@@ tial thinking is clo@@ sely connected to how we understand a most of our environment .
people always ask me , what do you do in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ p ?
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ sti@@ cles give off in the fe@@ tal sta@@ dium of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
or even building stupid from these cities , or spread hundreds of the world ?
i only den@@ it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
in this period , there were 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how you build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
if you want to support at 100 percent on it , you need an incredible wonderful battery .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that land@@ ds in the atmosphere .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and i sent continu@@ to .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these kinds of attac@@ ks is not in the middle east .
you might ask , why would anyone actually invest time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low-@@ challenge ?
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article i kept making it .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction like anti@@ bodies attac@@ king a human .
and because you burn this 99 percent , that &apos;s free profi@@ le is much better .
we grow from from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our beginning were spon@@ ges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
rec@@ ession . still . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
a school uni@@ form to to the bo@@ le , because she had to pass six years .
over time , we focus using the large animals , and in the sea , are the big fish .
an effect , parado@@ x@@ ically is that it &apos;s paraly@@ zed instead .
so let me introdu@@ ce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human load car@@ rier .
you can &apos;t call it that , that would be a little poli@@ tically cor@@ rect rect .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get evil , look away , don &apos;t look .
and to my ex@@ pos@@ , i had not just written it , i also sent to the court .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
thank you for hun@@ ting a fear of hot . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
so , we don &apos;t need to be eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be climate positive .
and if you do that , you finally get cy@@ ber mass mass destruction .
and my love of the ocean kee@@ holding , with the same inten@@ sity as e@@ h and ever .
when each of you were born in this room , there were 6@@ ,000 languages on the world on earth .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side c@@ hyper@@ bubble .
and instead of economic stand@@ still , i see one of the greatest economic im@@ ch@@ h of history .
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered from a fi@@ u@@ sive crisis .
a about all a esti@@ ma@@ ted friend@@ dness : somebody actually brought her a few shoes .
so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you can put online .
and yet in our country there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
so what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system .
the family who fear of his life took off all the g@@ uns and all the tools .
we bran@@ ch from a common ancestors to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
at this point , i was going to per@@ to the car@@ di@@ ological layer in the car@@ di@@ ological service .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to to like to think , but to just do it propor@@ tion@@ ately .
and you really have to stay quite coun@@ ting , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ fair enjo@@ ys and bed@@ man .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might es@@ cape some of the nu@@ ces in this picture .
a woman in germany has about six comm@@ ma e@@ ats three kil@@ ogra@@ ms in their life .
that fact is often put in a context with the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ tious numbers .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
do you want to was@@ butt@@ ons or or conclu@@ ing ? stone or ac@@ id ?
his new ma@@ sche is now , &quot; why is &apos;t going to be discus@@ sed anymore ? &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs ... &quot; i write my name .
i think there are the ted group in the ted that are already enga@@ ged there .
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot further .
so you don &apos;t have to get up classi@@ cal music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
she pus@@ hed me so that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the , and then she let me go .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ ded that aspe@@ ct in narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but secre@@ , i really really wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
but in this case , we have to give full gas and get a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians are never done anything .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently and i &apos;ve asking , why ?
so , we pre@@ tend it &apos;s impossible impossible to live a sou@@ l .
there are technical concep@@ ts , such as aug@@ mented reality , which is the exten@@ ded reality .
even though i &apos;m in the fire@@ department , i &apos;m interested in in py@@ ro@@ technologi@@ cal things .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever forever forever as fast as fast as now .
what a story of it is break@@ through@@ ks , meaning@@ ful moments ws and end .
one of the co@@ m@@ als ment of ci@@ als was this mas for christ@@ mas .
in the after@@ noon , people here and there doing calls and moving .
so we &apos;re supposed to see them as something that is supposed to be present to our lives .
yes , children are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers too .
or c , because they have as@@ ham@@ to them that they &apos;re in@@ pi@@ ate .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with ima@@ points .
a story that acts with new issues like the environmental crisis .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people from get people from it .
there are enzy@@ mes called the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
that &apos;s , of course , can only , if you &apos;re only man@@ man@@ man@@ here in some way .
in an emergen@@ cy layer , i &apos;ve over@@ sed a blind blind am@@ am@@ tion twice .
now these decisions are diff@@ er in the number of choices that they &apos;re provide per decision .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
it &apos;s it in sh@@ ell and ab@@ und@@ ance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
i don &apos;t know if you knew this already , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
but if something like this happens here , it changes the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative circum@@ stances .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and lo@@ ving , and workers are in wa@@ ge and bread .
it conver@@ ts co2 into me@@ than@@ e using hydro@@ gen as an source of energy .
it means to out something that is in one that is is to ti@@ ck@@ le the potential .
we can get them to do things they thought couldn &apos;t .
but the primary medium was language , the language , something very natural , something very vi@@ thing .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on free foot , the place venue is un@@ known .
we tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it to the mini@@ um components .
and so i started playing around it , and i found that something was going on there .
well , they were also highly technical and they were to exten@@ sive planning .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and inter@@ with the people .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ using .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
finally , the positive alternative mix@@ es with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
sounds crazy . but again , this goes back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes how information can be used .
at every point where you throw away , from , yes , you again create life .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ary tried to contact contact make a sever@@ e er@@ ror .
it &apos;s about the values that are in this words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
and if we have an energy sur@@ plus , we &apos;ll also have water in ab@@ und@@ ance .
this woman ended then com@@ pla@@ ining , the portra@@ it wouldn &apos;t look similar to her .
because if the wine is that far , and the person &apos;s there , i open it up .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
they &apos;re 75 percent of energy consumption -- 80 percent of co2 emissions .
for example , here &apos;s , a study that we did in a magazine magazine ine .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information information .
their own photos are be sig@@ na@@ ed with meta@@ data that which another person has enter@@ in .
well , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 put it up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a visual cloud .
and this really starts with a fundamental response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts right away .
it makes safe sense to be less har@@ m@@ ful in terms of oil consumption .
but very alien , it &apos;s for la@@ ia , we what musi@@ cians with our music language .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to restri@@ ct it .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that magic and magic were re@@ placed by machines .
but even though you trans@@ late these attac@@ ks , it &apos;s still ins a bit of technical .
we need to encoura@@ ge people not to be afraid of possibilities that might might sc@@ fy them .
we know exactly where all at@@ at@@ machines are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ king .
i made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films , for a very small audience .
what happened after that is the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
and what &apos;s only you want to see how van go@@ gh had created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to smart from this code .
the reason for this is because it requires a lot of trust to play play with game .
then the next steps steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
the mon@@ k came at mid@@ night and said he had to close the sar@@ in .
green is gift , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is input and orange is c@@ able .
i calcul@@ ated that the time took 21 billion hours of hours a week .
you can make your opini@@ on , in every chan@@ nel , at any given time , and they do it .
and if your employees can &apos;t hold them apart , your custom@@ ers can &apos;t . &quot;
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but but no significant memor@@ ies .
a year ago or so , i read a study that really ble@@ w me mind .
so not zer@@ os and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but just a metaphor .
and so we started the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
they already have a construction site , and they already mention this area for the second city .
what &apos;s interesting today is that re@@ al-@@ time control systems are starting to show up in our lives .
but one of them may like , with some , two happiness , two numbers into the right order .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th , it was the second time it was appro@@ ved with 1@@ 14 to a voice .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
here are the four things i found . first of all , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever &apos;s next .
i think this success pressure has de@@ na@@ yed our artists over the last 500 years .
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and so you don &apos;t want to do with ni@@ x .
and if we were to show that to people then we can drive a behavi@@ oral change .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to force ourselves to the environment by by ...
in the co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious dan@@ ger to our business .
and he called that part of its course the x factor , the potential of human will .
and it was with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
you can go to the website , down@@ lo@@ ading all the design facili@@ lations and self-@@ assem@@ ble them .
so that really like that , that means , we &apos;re here at the moment in the middle of a transition .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a matter of choice .
one of the things , you you know , has been been ligh@@ ten@@ ed , there &apos;s a lot of r@@ ors .
we know that an develop@@ mental process is not opti@@ mal , if it gets too complicated .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
but that also brings me back to the point , when when are things going to be more intui@@ tive ?
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a a challen@@ one as a brand .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very comfortable .
we &apos;ve up a little che@@ ability directly in the ent@@ r@@ ance .
the first steps of history that i told you took one billion years a piece .
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been been gu@@ ed at the beginning of the talk .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
we sele@@ ct some ro@@ cks every year , and we &apos;ll let them work with city admini@@ wards .
so here &apos;s a young female and a male in a tracking game .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ ctive , which is prop@@ he@@ t .
extremely important is now , extremely important important , and much , it &apos;s going to be more important in the future .
so when i travel@@ ed and visit these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
this is the work very smart people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
and then suddenly you you suddenly see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
and over a period of a year and a half two hours , she started to feel better .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think think about our future as a experience as an experience .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
you find crazy examples from all over the world , how people optimi@@ ze the system and re@@ fin@@ ing it .
i think we have to do something against a different piece of medical culture .
now , should i tell you what happened one night when all the sensor@@ s working .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different time , in different light .
all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and you know what to do .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of living alive ?
and it would be best best if it could do them , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
instead of breaking your head over it , you just burn it . a great thing .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we ended up in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
that invol@@ des everything , the food we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , i don &apos;t , because i &apos;m a ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
the second story is supposed to make another concept , which is the transforma@@ able ta@@ ill sp@@ an .
it leads to star@@ vation die . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ rest .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , how to get a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ ables .
so i shif@@ ted that , and i made this other movie about the big ship that &apos;s going to ing .
we put up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king te in front of the hospital .
and i came to the cru@@ x stat@@ ement that a new city is provi@@ ding people new possibilities .
if we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really get down to zero ?
and this is a problem that often see , when you look at the long li@@ sts of all these f@@ on@@ ds .
and now i &apos;m conne@@ cting the fil@@ ters with the dru@@ ms so that i can control the effect live .
this is one of the explan@@ ations that are given to the domin@@ ance of memory itself .
and those of you who are interested in can go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
i think opini@@ mo@@ s@@ sad , , the mo@@ s@@ is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
now , last year , in this site , there were 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different ways .
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be gri@@ m as trees , right ?
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
so he would work exactly as well for example -- in a power plant or in a car factory .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
when countries meet in places like cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
have you taken a two-@@ ons or third opini@@ on , how you say beautiful today ?
i had introduced a kind of penguins penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once portra@@ yed a woman .
now the first project i want to introdu@@ ce you is actually one of the first of our lab .
she saved my life by using me the toi@@ let in the teacher &apos;s room .
as a young law@@ yer , i had the great privi@@ lege of meeting p@@ ink par@@ ks .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a comp@@ , fascinating and terri@@ fying possibility .
and that leads to less happiness with the out@@ comes , even if the results are good .
the great possible break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest thing you know ?
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not always telling their symptom@@ s in the same way .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i will ever be .
my life is really extra@@ ordin@@ arily bl@@ essed by working on some amazing projects .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ ther , but no one ever vot@@ sen farmers .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph and mark a piece of tree mr@@ i .
she said , &quot; the first thing i jum@@ ped that you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ bra@@ te an object at the same time , not to vi@@ bra@@ te ?
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
and after that , we looked at which case people were to buying a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
and none of these stories are quite or great -- but one of them is this clear .
this is six thousand countries that control 40 percent of oil supp@@ ills .
this &apos;s not about the details of the slide of the slide , but &apos;s about the general form .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order come in decisions .
oh , and by the way this fl@@ amin@@ gos shouldn &apos;t even be there in the front .
every second every day , our senses catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
these fix@@ sts were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ a si@@ si@@ ance is an inter@@ active computer in the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
that means -- look , i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
we &apos;re che@@ aper as the same system if the same same five is ris@@ up a year .
there &apos;s no normally de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date .
think that a group of students today can affect the billions of people &apos;s lives .
that &apos;s of done this a lot of us@@ us@@ tili@@ ly friend@@ ly , but of course it &apos;s much better than that .
we could just gli@@ p as as am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous m@@ m@@ ers through the world oceans .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
please watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s on the water line .
it was all the k@@ f@@ a then then the je@@ wish was called k@@ f@@ a .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all of this in there .
she came from school one day , and she &apos;s a teacher , and she was talking about a student .
well , there are all kinds of play@@ ful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring much .
he wanted to catch capture the feelings play , so he built a camera in front of the players .
so what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led human , or a powerful person ?
it has nothing to special to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gen , ur@@ ani@@ di@@ ance .
as a doctor , you can do good . as as a car@@ doctor , but you can do do more .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts , an opini@@ on , or by their audience .
what i have to tell myself all the , when i &apos;m going to talk about it , is don &apos;t have any fear .
unless it know that we know glob@@ ally acc@@ ag@@ um@@ ul@@ ating faster and faster and better .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did the beginning on youtube .
still , we are very , story@@ as of information information , , very ar@@ re@@ sted .
cer@@ ti@@ fied government government ha@@ cking and fa@@ ke cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
that means we first looked for to find the largest battery in the world .
because he led them to where he doesn &apos;t stop himself .
you use them in a sou@@ p kitchen , you clean a park in the neighborhood .
look at it clo@@ sely , this is the today , clean coal technology today .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects are missing .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a short super@@ view and a symbol for the area it comes from .
you invited them to you invited them to food , not for the nutri@@ ent the@@ ft .
we want to de@@ sh ate li@@ fel@@ life sentence without un@@ condi@@ tional ex@@ pos@@ ment for children .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global mortality -- sensitive system , of course .
you usually usually come out when you call in your city of 3@@ 11 .
they say that all the things that are shown up there following a life cycle .
and then when i as an adult , i i looked for a prof@@ ession it was a film@@ making .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , it runs out from me out of planning .
when was the last time you heard about somebody who was talking about mis@@ about fal@@ for@@ fail@@ ke about fal@@ fail@@ failure ?
it changes over time . it changes because for people their actions are quite natural .
and it makes me excited about terms of consi@@ der@@ der@@ about democracy .
so we met in dec@@ ember in the head of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
the sister who gave this bra@@ ve was brought to an education camp .
you need biological materials , of course , but you also need tools , and then that &apos;s a lab .
in my school time , i went to the bus to school , one hour an hour every day .
i have a very complicated here , dis@@ or@@ able and conf@@ used idea in my head .
this au@@ ro@@ gen ction around the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase of fire .
she felt that if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to qua@@ ke .
so there &apos;s profound lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed how tom spoke in the free sky , and i tried .
we &apos;re going to be as good at whatever to do , as the most important people in the world .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p called citizens connect . &quot;
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes you here , these are real time control systems .
that means we &apos;re about about five times more in the ground than re@@ educ@@ ated .
now , why do we draw graph@@ s in technology se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
i think the reason for this is because we realize anything &apos;s going on .
in a lie like this , you see that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and that &apos;s that b@@ w@@ l students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
beyond the cities , all of this percei@@ pe@@ ure and dri@@ p@@ them into objects of everyday life .
and what it does is it makes people into business and ask that question .
because i experienced it when i started a la@@ a la@@ go@@ on in 197@@ 1 .
i think the geni@@ re , the style i have is probably dark glamour . &quot;
and then he said three words -- the most words i &apos;ve ever heard .
and this is what led us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
this ch@@ art shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer .
a second circle already starts to cor@@ ate or ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limit@@ ies of possible .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotional , that ru@@ ined the whole experience .
this is a reali@@ stic case . this is a copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot;
he got in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and re@@ covered a few days later .
the un@@ healthy way i talk about is the makes you sick in the first .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
and our approach was just to say , oh , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone does under the ax@@ es .
and i would invi@@ te everyone to deal with it and also to try something out .
people are about to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how getting the government is into crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
we took little robots that we built that wra@@ wra@@ in a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
then you just consu@@ me what &apos;s on sun and wind there where they live .
if i asked you to count the great world religi@@ ons , what would you say ?
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
two few bu@@ w@@ s for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
this is going to cause the patient suff@@ er , but only a little less than less than before .
women , like men , have something that call ad@@ ren@@ al@@ gl@@ ands in gl@@ ands .
they call this there &quot; stre@@ aming trials &quot; in the united states we call this &quot; tracking . &quot;
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the sh@@ ar@@ f , there &apos;s no sorry for er@@ ors .
well , we rele@@ take a lot of carbon dio@@ xide year , over 26 billion tons .
it &apos;s bee@@ tho@@ ven , you know that he heard more than he had become dea@@ f .
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose , people falls a lot very hard to to decide .
it &apos;s a means that the sou@@ l of a particular culture access to the material world .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ ii in the middle of 18@@ th century .
and the old ada@@ ge &quot; when it ble@@ loo@@ es , the demand &quot; ris@@ up &quot; is very true .
198@@ 8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets of sk@@ ate pun@@ k , except on was@@ hing day .
in a fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and and each movement below my bas@@ yer .
and because i &apos;m in the fire man &apos;s , i &apos;m interested interested in for py@@ ro@@ technologi@@ cal things .
in the united states , you start to measure the experience of the population .
but what i would re@@ gre@@ t because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ce@@ o has been at the week with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the de@@ vil with it .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
and i got a bad sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t come from there .
and the si@@ ft@@ ables is an example of a new generation of manipu@@ ating digital data .
that we are not fully developed as humans as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
well , at efficiency , the e , energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
just tell me a little bit how this is connected to your mind and feelings about yourself .
i think that this can be changed by creating re@@ combin@@ ed vac@@ cin@@ es in the v@@ ance .
in california , a 40 percent redu@@ ction in the s@@ s@@ now cei@@ ling of the si@@ er@@ ra .
but then search essi@@ ve just pulled this scri@@ pt as a primary medium , received .
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development .
i think the whole picture makes sense if you divi@@ it into a few billion steps .
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
more than anything , anything else , is my only goal in life , is to be a good father .
and he knew her he would have been able to contribu@@ te it .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dig@@ ni@@ ty that to respect the law .
capital , chemistry and machines are on on it , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
so the com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ end on us are interpre@@ ted that are rein@@ vent@@ ing the pieces .
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
do we have to introdu@@ ce emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try to keep earth &apos;s temperature stable ?
a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
the question i want to ask to here today is : is this idea for you is perfectly fine ?
first , a ball game in bon@@ o@@ bo way -- and i don &apos;t think of foot@@ ball .
because sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource liber@@ ating force .
but otherwise , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important to your life .
we now have a ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
so recently , scientists came to realize that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
i think it &apos;s very high to say we &apos;re the final product of evolution .
and this , not of these these pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single wee@@ k@@ week .
i ask , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
we ad@@ just to our a@@ ments to the new level , and we don &apos;t re@@ mind us what was there .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our war@@ ning system , our driving dete@@ ctor .
i feel that we have to encoura@@ ge people as we pres@@ gr@@ is to take risks .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that epi@@ c vic@@ tory make so possible in online worl@@ ds .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so forth .
so what is it for an idea of thinking in hon@@ dur@@ as to build a whole new city ?
so let &apos;s look at every factor in let and and think how how we get this to zero .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , forever ?
and the a students are trouble te@@ sted , the better teachers and so forth .
for good things as evil , and perhaps so@@ to think as you might think , these decisions will be about us .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days they gave themselves to the one .
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks , and b has those benefits and risks .
that means that this first impres@@ sion is happening at a rapi@@ fast speed of how we percei@@ ve things .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both put together in the idea of happiness .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe pro@@ mot@@ ed a lot of development projects .
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , even the wrong sal@@ ad res@@ sing .
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that un@@ spar@@ ks the people &apos;s people here ?
and that ev@@ ening i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
they &apos;re never get pleas@@ ant surprise because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
let &apos;s first look at reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their off@@ spring .
yeah , you already feel it when you &apos;re hot@@ ter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong there .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about this is that government is not the same as politics .
this creates a very strong picture in its head . this is much stron@@ ger much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
we work with universi@@ ties very sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa and invi@@ te them to learn social design .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at the time time human human used equ@@ ously media produ@@ cer and medium himself .
every own music is made platform if you &apos;re com@@ char@@ ged from the outside with music .
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to , and then we &apos;re talking about the personal step .
this could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of being , &quot; she puts him in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
so many people we now now in the world who spend at least one hour a day playing online .
it is about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about story@@ telling .
we came to the fact , for example , we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of ib@@ &apos;s super@@ computer wat@@ son at risk ? &quot;
and the reality of that expression reach@@ es all of us , and moves , inspired and com@@ bine us .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , that &apos;s like an au@@ tar@@ &apos;s system .
and if you make good sh@@ ots , the result can be pretty beautiful and also pretty reali@@ stic .
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you you a different time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that &apos;s in the internet culture of tech@@ ies and ge@@ e@@ ks .
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want sna@@ ke , slightly obvious or range ?
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , with with the idea of percei@@ ving our and power@@ ing our environment .
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on em@@ vo@@ ment@@ ing the same approach@@ es the development of vac@@ cin@@ ine .
and dr. p@@ . was always fly very color@@ ed flies and was just the way to work with kids .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , it needs to be involved into film art . &quot;
all these photos are connected connected , and it creates something that bigger than the sum of the parts .
i even come to one of my loved ones , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
that didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play that much with particles .
the real meaning of the word that educ@@ is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
she was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped their world picture very much .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever .
and this happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs legs , not despite that experiences .
and this is , for us human humans , is always something bit intui@@ tive if i have to think about it in in the possible way .
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their school tas@@ ks under the street light .
it &apos;s become the and one of the most important private bird reser@@ ves today across europe .
in fact , we thought the end here , but we tried to get the process further .
i worked with people with d@@ war@@ war@@ m growing -- so people who were smaller than common .
when something was happening then , people knew what this was was . they called it on their name .
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we are now in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time in human history .
but we know , if we talk about that , social social propor@@ tions are very sensitive dis@@ rup@@ ted .
virtu@@ ality suddenly has become alien alien to us , and has has nothing to do with reality .
and listen , everybody has a right to their opini@@ on , even a right to their opini@@ on of progress .
you have to go up , go past the fire , and you have to get some shoes of this woman . &quot;
well , unfortunately , we tend of see this face in real life , when we face difficult problems .
climate climate tics : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for those to convince you ?
now for me and for com@@ pos@@ ers then and what they might mean for him today .
by the way , a year about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electric power are built on the same basis in the world .
and the child is playing after a memor@@ break , rather than a red now plays a blue flo@@ wer before before .
within a year , you do a a survey , and then you start with commercial fishing fishing .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m is , i would say , ne@@ able fly .
i myself learned him from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic from the path fin@@ der in the 197@@ 0s .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can just scale them .
is this something you can participa@@ te with , because you &apos;ve have a few minutes left ?
we need digital security systems there where a human machine service can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural industrial model for the future .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ like it &apos;s not .
but at the time that multi-@@ tic@@ ular organisms came ared , things started changing things .
and i think our philosoph@@ y of pun@@ ish@@ ment doesn &apos;t help anybody .
4 : mal@@ ig@@ nant car@@ tel@@ s . speak@@ er 5 : dangerous cru@@ ise ships .
it allows us to do much much higher complexity than the normal metho@@ ds to produce .
and the basic lesson , i think the construction is actually a connection spor@@ ts .
there will be this little blood pressure measu@@ re@@ ment that you put to an iphone or something .
no , not because we &apos;re already producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just .
but it ended up of the point that i took space scientists , with us into the deep sea .
over the last three decades , the crime rate rate in america has dec@@ lin@@ ing .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able any community to feed themselves ?
this is here i think , the art and the film might be able to fill the gap and simu@@ lations .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else but working information within the organis@@ m .
now look at what was happening that day , just in obser@@ or the activity that happening in the network .
i spend most of my time with people in investi@@ gation , pris@@ ons or death cells .
don &apos;t wait to make one difference in someone else &apos;s life until you &apos;ve reach@@ ed your first million .
put this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and you made a noise machine .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion cur@@ ve .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese ans did something in the direction .
as an example , the most sophisti@@ tle version of this this kind of communication is human language .
you need that lie to keep a life alive to keep self-@@ de@@ de@@ ception .
but now there &apos;s a coura@@ ge@@ ous , new solution to free us out of this mis@@ situation .
you &apos;re you a up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that brings your blood into wh@@ all@@ es ?
so , it &apos;s about creating a big foot@@ print , that becomes a we@@ t@@ land .
you &apos;ll never forget forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
he understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone deal with it are two different things .
so three very difficult problems that might be able to solve , and that &apos;s you want to work on .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard of before will join global communication .
the categ@@ ories have to say something to the vot@@ ers , not which provi@@ des the choice .
we want to get things that have disappe@@ ared or things that are no longer the as they were .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ tes fit to everything .
it was about a method that parents can figure out which are the right public schools for their children .
and one reason is that this enormous heat he@@ ats green@@ land from the north .
and that &apos;s an idea that , when you think about it , can only ful@@ fill you with hope .
whether he &apos;s a place of a mind or a bunch of er@@ z , is ir@@ relevant .
the day before the event , i called the bo@@ ss of public work for the company .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
the second largest attac@@ ker group we can see today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
if you know something about government technology , you know that it &apos;s usually not like way .
instead of pus@@ ging the water , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to bring the water back .
now this may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and you can &apos;t understand the ti@@ bet@@ ts of suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
because phosp@@ hor@@ us is em@@ it@@ ted to the pig@@ s over the strong ingre@@ di@@ ents of ex@@ cre@@ ment .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is connected to everything .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
and the color sounds and color sha@@ ps you may remember , &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d this was mentioned so often today .
that can be , in our case that we use it to design design and make a symbol .
when you turn on the lights on , it looks like this . so is the same way we saw it before .
they do it because they can follow the contro@@ versi@@ ted white line on the country of the high@@ street a@@ 9@@ 2 .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ ro@@ ws have written last year .
so i started thinking about what it is , what these games are doing inside us .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low-@@ challenge does is it it helps you identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
imagine the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes in different solutions .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ , you have to reach the need@@ le .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded by your der , you &apos;ll notice that too , and you can get a little nervous .
so what about this with the virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to .
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15@@ in@@ ches .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to make negative energy from my life .
if paul talks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t say without ar@@ med gu@@ di@@ els .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is , we started to abstra@@ ct ct .
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you &apos;ve actually taken .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classi@@ classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des cab@@ rio .
that will be , i think , in the next decade or two , will be part of the national statistics .
and not only that , we used our imagination to de@@ th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly this world .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not dam@@ &apos;s special meat .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the oceans as we &apos;ve be@@ aten fore@@ sts .
they help with di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve food nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution but it has to be appro@@ ved by con@@ gress .
and this was an example in how our own governments use using technology against us , citizens .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types , who challenge social nor@@ ms .
as we fall down , i had that feeling of dying , is not terri@@ fying .
we want to fight bi@@ pa@@ tion and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system .
at the end of every day , i coo@@ ked a po@@ t sou@@ p that we shared .
you &apos;ve probably heard about the level high , and &quot; + one strength or or + one intelligence .
for us and it , play is fundamental to atta@@ ch@@ ment of relationships and nur@@ care of toler@@ ance .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
now you might think that the whole thing of categ@@ ories of someone like me would make really happy .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children to the natural world with their technology .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ players . 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something . &quot;
but these article were worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i found it out .
what would you do that you were pus@@ hing , because you think you &apos;re there there forever ?
for one thing , the energy den@@ sity that these technologies are dra@@ matically lower than the power plants .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never percei@@ true than today that less is more .
a tv set or a was@@ hing machine that just use it it don &apos;t use it .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this ro@@ tten stuff , like mani@@ ok .
but the more i thought about it , the more i thought i that the fish knows something .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going , with a normal , stin@@ el@@ normal electro@@ chemical battery .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ e is the battle heart of our global climate system .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans , equ@@ ally , life is made of teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean , that we wanted to have a background conversation .
put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , you get get signific@@ antly .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other things called the es@@ ol@@ ar that has great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 is really very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is i changed the order in which this information is pres@@ ented .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
that means 15 po@@ pounds of wild fish necessary get a po@@ und of tun@@ a .
our cities have been , in the last few years , equi@@ pped with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
no , they didn &apos;t destro@@ y the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
when these ima@@ points fall down , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
i believe that somehow of you &apos;ve dra@@ wn to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
it &apos;s absolutely ama@@ z@@ ingly cold and sea himself to us who can afford it .
and now what we can read in the daily newspaper every day , which you can find in this third sentence .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the lower part has been mani@@ pul@@ ated .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and a that it otherwise doesn &apos;t have .
or are we to being something else -- something that may be better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we &apos;re all fighting , about who to talk ; they &apos;re allowed to speak them .
an example of this from a very different area . mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ ero@@ tic x-@@ times .
because obviously , an animal that is very common , once r@@ ar@@ ely before it dies out .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ction of the song is the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing significant games together to try to survive a another century on this planet .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and that &apos;s on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
and i want to please give to proto@@ col@@ l , that i was today for my part of the jobs , guys .
and the prepar@@ ation that were enormous . we had to build c@@ ameras and the head@@ lights and all kinds of things .
you have to make the sound of the win@@ ds , b@@ low it away and read the rest of the book .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with digital information , the genome of ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
and the next piece of puzz@@ puzz@@ le is about four women in three generations together to build a new life together .
we &apos;ve come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
just to give you some view , i zo@@ om in out so you can see what you get .
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something like this &apos;s going to happen here .
and as part of it , they gave us an concept that was ated by an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ali@@ ties .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly sto@@ al evolution , but they &apos;re dis@@ hau@@ ent@@ ous .
players love to be an a@@ ary mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary out@@ put .
i thought to me as if we got our send our clo@@ cks and dre@@ aming c@@ ameras from it .
in china china , a night night is still still hon@@ ey po@@ ts ts , so , right ?
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no fla@@ vation in their treatment .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of phosp@@ hor@@ us in the world .
i was the second volunte@@ er at the brand point , so i had quite good chan@@ ces into it .
it actually took a few years to start with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as this slide should be show .
how can we keep them longer fresh -- better fresh , more new@@ fresh , three times fr@@ ones .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ ster players .
and the side b@@ nant ones make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ers and putting them next to each other , he can let the characters interact ...
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough how cru@@ cial this factor can be for a person &apos;s life .
the next puzz@@ le shows how a boat is going out in the early morning red quie@@ tly in la@@ ke .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
either fl@@ m@@ fusion &quot; or a par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , you &apos;ll have a choice .
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of sti@@ cks , st@@ cks , pe@@ w@@ les and sh@@ ells .
and in reality , when we fail when when we hit ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel different .
for them , life had given her a task : the es@@ cape of your family and a new life in australia .
to these arch@@ a@@ ic models heard that we have basically a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the new day , they go -- woman prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
and so you see animals called right right next to a 500 degrees c that they can survive there .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son at the myster@@ y science theater was first to make a jo@@ ke on twitter .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting bur@@ den , you &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing the brilli@@ ence of the lie .
already dem@@ lo@@ ed today in some flat of la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e from itself out of the water .
they &apos;re strong sur@@ lations tions because we don &apos;t look at the problem as same as we should .
so we can understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
also , despite her log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic lost on the left , it goes up@@ ward .
so probably , or l@@ ush a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ture , fis@@ fishing ming , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably the most yellow child boo@@ auth@@ or in america .
2 : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . o@@ .@@ c. spra@@ y of police .
somehow somehow managed to find their time to ac@@ qui@@ re english and it@@ quali@@ cations .
now re@@ produce all the rema@@ rema@@ ining that best best care by numbers .
his mother was lo@@ cked up as a pun@@ ish@@ ment ment for -- to be weal@@ thy .
that just do this just more shape and more beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better mana@@ ge@@ able .
we need to prevent people from ac@@ zing things , especially things , especially when they &apos;re true .
but it &apos;s not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is cally seen the european .
it sounds very spac@@ ig , and it sounds very like science fi@@ ction , i know .
in this country , , for children , there are li@@ fel@@ ong offen@@ ences without condi@@ tional ex@@ pos@@ ment .
here &apos;s requi@@ red to bring what we understand under poli@@ tically cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness to bring over and over again .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
now , let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century so that we can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the development .
this is almost limited to with security security -- possibly also to the fish , definitely for us .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff we discovered -- actually ble@@ w me out of the so@@ cks .
and that &apos;s half of all se@@ wa@@ ge problems around the world that are caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ lege , anti@@ i@@ c@@ ess , from enti@@ cy .
the idea of this is obviously not just , list the machine oper@@ ators in the control room .
so we could sc@@ ar ate the world very easily with a sho@@ one , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now , when i was a ne@@ ul@@ ing in college , i had my first biology class class .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes are not running with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
we say , &quot; computers , please gener@@ generate a hundred million rand@@ om@@ ly ec@@ sen sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
so we know from this study that you have to reach the need@@ le if you go to the thing .
we know that as a human beings , opti@@ mal , when we do hard , meaning@@ ful work .
perhaps an ancient understanding of return to the relationship between humans and the myster@@ y of creative .
we now have almost an infin@@ ite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and i think the most important point about this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
i brought you an example of the north american stem be the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
make the ways that are easy to use and start dealing with this one of embra@@ g patients in the team .
so we might sell a sho@@ e , and it will be the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever wor@@ ried ...
why not have fast muscle fi@@ bers that will en@@ able you to walk faster and longer ?
because the lesson i &apos;m try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and so , in terms of interest in this technology in this technology , i &apos;ve just going back into there .
there was a student high high school that brian gold@@ mann would learn for a blood test .
so if we see the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative news .
so i &apos;m about , : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , make it possible .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing bes@@ next to actual existence as being shape .
this question was so stri@@ king that we decided to explore the the answer and developed pris@@ si@@ ve .
if somebody asked you to describe their brand identity , their brand person@@ ality , how would it ?
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
and like many people , i thought that in the government is pri@@ mar@@ ily about choo@@ sing people into a office .
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by ti@@ pping the p@@ ace in one direction or another .
i &apos;m going to go to a statistics that most of you have heard before .
so there are all the tools , and the only thing that li@@ ts us is our imagination .
it is called gest@@ design law or gest@@ design psychology , which is also affec@@ ts us in perception .
and maybe we only know know what wood we &apos;re made of when we &apos;re actually te@@ sted .
a third sentence that immediately comes up in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
and so by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since his , i have to say , very successful introdu@@ ction .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice cre@@ am pac@@ aging , which is flu@@ id at room temperature .
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country did not really take place in the class of violent crime .
so for me , photograph@@ y it seemed more to be in the right place at the right time .
and that sa@@ dness really formed in a thought , which is that i just wish for one thing .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i have ever write by hand .
that &apos;s why a lot of people , and also look at this , just because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the des@@ cent of man .
do you say there &apos;s negative im@@ pac@@ ts that have to do with the clou@@ ds that make things around ?
well , you can see , in all cases cases , no no one has to be an ex@@ qu@@ tion@@ ble can@@ di@@ date .
and they too -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you fli@@ around . there &apos;s always quot@@ ing to do something important .
unfortunately , not in re@@ b@@ ach , but maybe you can help the frank@@ ance a little bit .
this is sort of de@@ ad@@ line that showed us the environmental models we need to stop .
this re@@ s@@ er will pro@@ pose , to invest the money in more security forces and sec@@ ure .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and pro@@ x@@ y state law@@ yers and office workers .
our memory tells us stories , what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
when i went back to 27 years later the fish was s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half of its size .
i was assu@@ sure that they &apos;t &apos;t te te . in fact , they won &apos;t even leave the glass .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your off@@ drive ?
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics who made me crazy were no fan@@ a@@ tics .
that &apos;s great . the roman@@ man didn &apos;t really think a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
nothing wal@@ out into my sle@@ e@@ ve , or comes out , not tri@@ ck@@ o@@ y , and you can study it everything .
this is also the entertain@@ ment of this talk , so i hope d d you yed it .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to gras@@ p the truly amazing things that make us up .
and recently done a study with ce@@ os , watching the ce@@ os for a week .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of colum@@ n often called &quot; travel@@ ing wave re@@ actor . &quot;
now , mor@@ gan , on the name of transpar@@ ency this : what &apos;s happened to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed this point a long time where choice impro@@ ved our public good .
it &apos;s for the designers , which have mostly in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the amazing laws of design .
40 percent of all people in the world get half their drin@@ king water from this mel@@ ting water .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exten@@ ded reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
i remem@@ ber@@ ed last year , when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es , and somehow people liked this .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be bad fund@@ ed if you wear the light red pants .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells and came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that &apos;s better that &apos;s more successful that &apos;s more ly ?
and this really attac@@ es these ideas to map these limit@@ ations to the available available on the screen .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times on our energy without changing its lifest@@ yle .
so we had to develop a new method that we put these little bits and cor@@ rect the mistakes .
that means we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , that lived about six million years ago .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and do this crazy case .
so we have the memory itself and the living itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
i ad@@ ore my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
if i go to a room -- as right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only had two years later when we moved to california .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
unfortunately , this &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species may have sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
i got another gift , which is to see into the future , and i come back and live differently .
so for the process of the learning process of music music language you need at least as long as the spo@@ ken language .
we &apos;ve managed to spend about a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
so we &apos;re che@@ at our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
because people come often often , they can &apos;t make it friend@@ ly so anyone can deal with it .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just just great -- until my physics therapy .
now , if i ever opened opened fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
people will roll themselves in their faith , so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t free them .
so here we see see again again see the dies@@ el , again , the whole , individual ag@@ gre@@ gate again .
and we can inst@@ all an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the micro@@ -@@ second area .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
so in other words , the future has s@@ hr@@ hr@@ in@@ king by a year since i was in the world .
if you surro@@ und with the right people , you don &apos;t only going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate it .
evolution is all about the ying of the genome to next generation , adap@@ tation and and generation after generation .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ ac@@ guy , which seems a little difficult , but maybe they say this about us .
so doing things like things -- you know , people of ban -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested .
well , just to conclu@@ de , i want to notice that i &apos;ve been talking lot a lot about the fa@@ thers .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
it it sounds ban@@ al first , but it &apos;s exciting when you closer into it .
super@@ vision , now i &apos;m sort of interact with the object , can zo@@ om in out , zo@@ om in .
they sho@@ ot the decision -- push it , even if it comes to their own best interest .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
if you break the gold@@ fish glass , so that everything is possible , you lower lower happiness .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go , and then incre@@ ases my strength and per@@ dur@@ ence .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called this di@@ v@@ ine spi@@ st of creativity &apos;s dam@@ er songs .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them through a few nu@@ cle@@ ti@@ des ?
in the rich world , diseases exist that millions millions of us even thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed only one generation , har@@ dly yet .
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might look like a hor@@ de vol@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and you get said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out . &quot;
this is a very basic service . is there light at home home to read the home@@ work ?
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch it being taken over in the next century .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again of it , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
because if we could figure that out , we would never have have pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human potential before .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and what &apos;s going happening right now .
i &apos;m sure i would never reach an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , and it seemed seemed pretty un@@ likely to me .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , is not going going to tell you about which the ver@@ ver@@ bra@@ um works on .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , my view , were the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
vac@@ cin@@ , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are success@@ success of the scientific method .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that produced over 400 billion ro@@ cks -- or 75 ro@@ cks for every person on the planet .
they played a cu@@ ce ce and the vic@@ tor@@ ies could break up into an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
that would have been been without the world dem@@ ands , but it makes it so much more important .
and to win , the device needs to make a better diagno@@ sis than a team of high-@@ sk@@ ed doctors .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since it laun@@ started .
the man &apos;s grand@@ father was not going to afraid of the arc@@ tic night or or the weather stor@@ m .
he has a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe recor@@ ders .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ ze the happiness of the two kinds of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense anymore -- this shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
as peter told us , they not only produce the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
the human part of this book , way at the end , of course is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;ll experience one that of course there are such predi@@ ctive , you can &apos;t prove that .
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , trial , and mistakes what turns out to be meaning@@ less .
my heart ra@@ ced , , was was zz@@ y while i was trying to gra@@ b was in front of me .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could make a , or we could make b .
but again , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something special happened : one of the ac@@ tors actually became over@@ scen@@ ingly .
in offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , in hou@@ arb@@ age , 20 is 20 percent of the crowd are now wind@@ a@@ now .
but here &apos;s &apos;s : if you get evidence evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
so , i &apos;m in front to one of my favorite pictures , serious of pie@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel in the met .
the first example requires what what lot of you know , and some esti@@ mate , a few of don don need at all .
so just just get these kinds of words that we also use in the language of poli@@ tically cor@@ rect speech over and over again .
so these ten@@ ten@@ ded to survive longer , and they were multi@@ p@@ ed in a greater ex@@ tent .
but these concep@@ ts of cy@@ ber age , which are us us re@@ discover these opportunities back back our cap@@ abilities .
and the main lesson that we think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
his conc@@ s of writing the piece , becoming more and more and more of my personal cause to play it .
but there &apos;s no clu@@ bs that we can look around where you learn how to do fire .
i want to explain to you to bit about this mechan@@ ism today or or get you which &apos;s something that you &apos;re un@@ familiar with .
the moment it was as if a film director would have requi@@ red a stage shift .
this is as if i were to say , your kid , it would only be three times rather than five times .
it turned out it actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want have anything to do with your movie . &quot;
i was to talking recently to oil oil industry , and they said they were in@@ ver@@ t this model .
if profess@@ ors get curious , they often often s@@ wal@@ wed up in this n research se@@ me@@ ster .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one els of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um that helps you get the jum@@ ps .
so happens is the machine age , and what happens is the book , and it &apos;s that &apos;s &apos;s the oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
and it &apos;s about solving a play@@ ful creative creative , solving a problem .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , it has to do with dec@@ ei@@ ving yourself .
so , we were able to connect the little digital war@@ head with ro@@ over control .
so the neurons are the information process@@ ing that these cell cell communities have built .
obviously obvious that it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
one method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used a lot times recently is evolution itself .
so , imagine at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws last year in boston the code for america &apos;s program .
so , by large , and large , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we &apos;ve actually determin@@ ed what the goal is .
so the idea is that we actually invol@@ ve people in which they do things together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
there are as contro@@ versi@@ al things like this gene@@ tically changing plants in cro@@ ap@@ ers .
they lie , they &apos;re che@@ ating , they &apos;re conf@@ used and producing really , dr@@ in@@ ous shapes .
you can go off and create your own museum online -- from all of these images , you can put your own colle@@ ction .
because the soil will die the mo@@ s@@ ses die off and the wind , and water was@@ hes the ground away .
well , an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve noticed it somewhere .
so that you can just be able as citizens , being able to deal with these scientific technologies .
it &apos;s about how satis@@ fied or deli@@ gh@@ , the person is when that person is thinking about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
at home in new york , i &apos;m head head the develop@@ mental department of a non-@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin hood .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pres@@ gent problems .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press on the tri@@ g@@ ger .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far do you take a piece of the future there .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break st into 20 pieces as you to know from docum@@ ent@@ ations .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself and ada@@ ting at the same time .
every year we lose so three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that really have to go back into cy@@ cles .
if anyone had built a two-@@ in@@ in@@ ch of high construction , he would have moved the price home .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the chemicals that have spread to un@@ equal quanti@@ ties in it .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins when the tri@@ g@@ ger is expres@@ sed .
the result is that i no matter where i &apos;m from , i &apos;m treated as if i pro@@ f@@ ed the de@@ mis@@ e .
but not only that -- mel@@ ting and connect connect it to the universe and other devices out there .
they re@@ re@@ ped the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of earth in way that no war has ever done .
and yet my interest in photograph@@ y started when i received my first digital camera started at the age of 15 .
for these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics just became another material .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ hall .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , productive members of the human community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is in@@ c , but also very very amount of time .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and it seemed to have a fer@@ ior with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re being taken by the mind . how can you damage to you ?
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutri@@ ents that they might want to offer them without eff@@ or@@ ts .
if you have 10 teams who typically typical it , you get about six that have stable structures .
there &apos;s an old african ada@@ ge : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is changed at time has mis@@ sed a lot of biology .
they live in a world that has information and communic@@ ations in ab@@ und@@ ance as no one could have predi@@ ded .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , to make much more valuable they are than it costs .
this is really important , because this is a reali@@ ght that is not in a single wiki@@ di@@ di@@ te .
and there &apos;s certainly ambi@@ gu@@ ity about how bad these are going to follow , but you &apos;ll be extremely bad !
you found an article with fal@@ se thought thought well , you could dete@@ ct the cre@@ ator of this thought .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , you understand it easier , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the country is set built on flo@@ wers .
if we can do that , then this data data data p , a a source source makes sense information .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
if a mind has these quali@@ ties , we can create reality and new forms of existence .
maybe that &apos;s the point of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , a perception of the ic@@ , a sense of our own power .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common , or at@@ titude to build the right prototyp@@ e .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve noticed with what &apos;s called the gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ -@@ technology .
i know that we can , and as far as far as it &apos;m concerned , this &apos;s something that the world needs now .
today we want to talk about how videos vi@@ ral , and then , is why it even matters .
the more opportunities they were available , the more likely they put all all their money in p@@ ure ure money accoun@@ ts .
never making a mistake , but no one is thinking about the details of how this should be done .
ah , what you can see here , exc@@ use me , is a little explan@@ ation of what you &apos;re about to see .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because people &apos;s hu@@ ur@@ ged to work together very quickly .
but dan@@ ny , in the entire american , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
there are very , very few things you can even say that there &apos;s a chance in a million .
ice ber@@ gs are born a cal@@ f of a gl@@ aci@@ er or by breaking out of ice she@@ ins .
our language indi@@ ts the changes of social that have been solved in many cases by a technologi@@ cal change .
i re@@ gre@@ t that that . but i &apos;m trying to learn best out of it to pass it on other people .
that was the reason . it was the exc@@ manufacturing . it was the business of american agriculture .
we made little pieces , we made a er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
so in this project , we actually designed a few little mark@@ ers to track the tr@@ ash as it wal@@ ks through the system .
and i noticed how much these deep@@ -@@ di@@ ks was similar , a space mission .
so the performance of working with prototyp@@ es is signific@@ lot -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
here , and today in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of the male black population perman@@ ently lost their vot@@ ing .
so when i come , with my little v w pi@@ es@@ el and i just wrong , that feeling comes up .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , which is our genes , are exactly the same code and the same pe@@ writer .
and so they wrote all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and called the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about &quot; the new new cin@@ ation , &quot; a little article .
now , since the film had the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val pre@@ mi@@ ere , we can look at this .
and so it &apos;s so so ro@@ ot@@ ed in us that that we can hand@@ le so well with virtu@@ ality .
so if you want to have it better , you have to cross here and keep your percentage of the deal .
and the first thing i asked the staf@@ question is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example that keep fil@@ ls the da@@ y@@ new@@ spa@@ pers .
it lives in the deep sea , about a year and a half miles deep , virtu@@ almost char@@ ing temper@@ atures .
i have to talk to the man on the street who are like me , ot@@ to-@@ normal user .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than any else on the planet .
through my work , i try to express that people are are separ@@ ated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
you can only be connected to some other chemicals in m@@ m@@ zing the ma@@ o den@@ at@@ u@@ zing .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it going to look like , we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them feel like they cannot ada@@ pt .
we had a team who was working on a project in boston last year for the three people needed a half two and a half months .
his un@@ cle fle@@ w into her hol@@ iness with the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
the next day , all went to the center to meet team of seven and prime minister at the same time .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space and move looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
back to my actual subject of natural interface and the top@@ ic , which is , , of course , is us@@ ability .
there &apos;s a extra te to cra@@ d@@ le-@@ to cra@@ d@@ , where anyone can participa@@ te .
now a language is not just the tot@@ ality of the vo@@ vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ar , or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ lo@@ s .
of the people who stand when it was 24 , only three percent actually actually bought a glass of mar@@ ch .
then , one day , he came back from walking , and he said , &quot; dad , my legs cri@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series , which i make with a simple balance program .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a ti@@ ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se image that has happened in the last 25 years .
for example , here , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ie@@ w in the u@@ kra@@ ine .
please help us and try to improve health , not just something , but take their hands .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that they can fli@@ away through the to the bio@@ diversity .
ad@@ v@@ ties are not ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to make make better realize with our lives .
and i hear , as a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
but not just any mission , but a mission that f@@ its perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
imagine that this artificial intelligence of every mobile phone &apos;s available .
his work is brilliant . he exam@@ at why people spend so much time time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry had a do@@ zen components , and look at the diversity that that came from this .
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ ms and surro@@ unded unded by some man@@ gro@@ ves .
sure sure i &apos;m going to sho@@ ck some po@@ ts of paint , but get new to it .
you have to , of course , to battery battery you you you to be able to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re to move them where we want to .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al er@@ ror , and that was the following .
but the challenge is to try figure out which it is and why we keep tain it , and whether they make sense .
now , i don &apos;t like that question , because she &apos;s driven the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
&quot; i know boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the ar@@ est ocean .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than in real life .
and also , there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
some of you may have heard about a couple of weeks ago , i turned an ad on e@@ bay .
maybe you can stand up for a moment , so that you can pause to the two about the project .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from a piece to the next puzz@@ le , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit together .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at how big these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the images are .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this this , can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
if you want to know how sea level goes es through the land ice mel@@ ting here it fre@@ flo@@ ws into the sea .
it &apos;s actually so soli@@ d ly in its place that i can sha@@ ke it without fall@@ fall@@ down the kni@@ fe .
so the question i want like ask ask , and a many times , is like this new world will be like ?
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this our country .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om into one of my favorite parts of this image , until i &apos;m really really in the cra@@ cks .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
that all of a sudden i look this and and in@@ important for success , the us@@ ability is becoming a app@@ lic@@ ation .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click this now .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are , you &apos;re not going to get the cor@@ rect answer .
we are so far that we , only for the purpose , we can write ourselves thing in this code .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel sen@@ the t@@ we@@ et , who made the video so popular .
and it showed that today human pattern recogni@@ tion better fol@@ ds the proteins than the best super@@ computers .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we going to contribu@@ te to that area as well .
and then we started , we went to the &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , and we explor@@ ed it with robo@@ tic experiences .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than right now , 70 percent .
now , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph@@ .@@ d. student at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than coun@@ tri@@ ina .
and the last game , we bring out on mar@@ ch 3@@ rd , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
so you have to have another philosop@@ hi@@ cal top@@ of this which is a perman@@ ent burn out of philosoph@@ y .
to do that , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
in particular , the last two words sho@@ ck me under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; all &quot; healthy . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indi@@ ans then , we jum@@ ped into a car and we wir@@ ling across the sky .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . just do it . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot;
each of you , everybody -- right like rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , and it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t &apos;t the wind all the time .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , expres@@ ses how to understand the future .
she opened a computer business , then she did a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic education , and opened up another business .
this is a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of reading in construction to see the scale .
even better , he was grown in a@@ a@@ ac@@ ak@@ ture after the pos@@ ed@@ ly highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
nature &apos;s fan@@ t@@ asy knows no boundar@@ ies , as op@@ posed to our own , lon@@ al human imagination .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it were some brilliant , and we got the break@@ through .
i &apos;ve just asked if this bag there &apos;s a talking bag and and mine rather will talk .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
i decided that rele@@ ase free , flies flies this year be be contribu@@ tion to the environment here .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fu@@ els , burn of either coal or natural gas .
how does it compare with the arab spring and the things that happened in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just if i was in a science fi@@ ction movie .
they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
can i use that directly , or need i need the man@@ ual , or i need an an cor@@ respon@@ ding training for it .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es out of flo@@ in markets and in secon@@ d-@@ trade sh@@ ops .
in a pris@@ on@@ ception , my sister and i would have dr@@ un@@ ned her and my grandmother grandmother grandmother of it .
i just have to get out a little bit , and that &apos;s what ha@@ cking is doing on modern molecular biology .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally present within the shi@@ pping w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
then we pa@@ sted the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , on the tr@@ ash and started to pur@@ sue it .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids going to school .
the most important post there for nuclear weapons development is the ani@@ an-@@ in@@ cen@@ tive institution in nat@@ ance .
but when we com@@ bine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just kind of look wrong .
and even though i gradu@@ ated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you &apos;re pi@@ cky in the sele@@ ction .
and so you can speed up the particles a lot enough enough , and then you can go into the oni@@ on .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
so western governments provide tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments governments so that can do to their own citizens .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nest st@@ les , fe@@ bre@@ ts , hall@@ mark , to discover this kind of brand@@ ing .
the chromo@@ some that in the cell has no one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we ad@@ ed ed .
his flexi@@ ble design allows us to ar deep , cra@@ w@@ ling and to ec@@ ute bene@@ le mov@@ ements .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that con@@ con@@ vi@@ ds to 10@@ -@@ year-old children children to death in ja@@ il .
are they establi@@ shed , tradition@@ ally , nur@@ sing , prote@@ ctive , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ?
and there could go the vis@@ it@@ ors into the room , put themselves on this chair , sit on this hel@@ met .
and maybe some of you have read new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; over@@ planes . &quot;
unfortunately , i was much too young so that he was already already emer@@ ated when i finally started studying .
and the first project is something that a few years ago , we did in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
that &apos;s very good things and poverty re@@ duc@@ means to make available available to this services almost everyone on the planet .
we &apos;re so imagine with our industrial partner of this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
she remin@@ ded me that now i was as old as they were then when we clim@@ bed the boat .
this is just an example of many how adults in posi@@ in power power can stimu@@ late a child &apos;s imagination .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve came from -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
we were doing docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but we were doing science , in fact , space science .
i once to through the new@@ spa@@ pers and look for the best head@@ lines i could find .
once i saw that that there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ in there , you know that .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;re all in spa@@ tial in this cally rel@@ related to each other .
and that team that regul@@ rules and gets at work the performance of the team will signific@@ antly improve .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined , they will be the first country in the world , w@@ ins ins phosp@@ hor@@ us .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to k@@ is@@ s . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we really need to solve in the real world .
our inten@@ tion to di@@ ve and see inside the ship , which had never been done before .
and the only problem is you think you can change virtual worl@@ ds , but not real ones .
because you see , i &apos;m invest@@ ing everything i have . i don &apos;t have any more than that .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve seen sort of now in the last two years , that the scientists are put up on my side .
and as i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ ania &apos;s eyes a a change change going on .
here are the ones that have been stri@@ in recent few years with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed .
they tend tend to choose for things that you make less satis@@ fied , even if you make it obje@@ ctive better .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become vic@@ ti@@ ms of a offen@@ al , not less .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and let it in .
and my head became we@@ ak over this coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had on the ev@@ ening .
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago where i saw my first ice e@@ berg .
if you really want to exist , come back to a che@@ aper moment , if i can take care of you .
they &apos;re not being taught little kids , which is , if nothing is taken taken , they &apos;re actually already dead .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy you don &apos;t help .
to this days , i feel deep@@ est a@@ we what i see at my di@@ ves .
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;m ima@@ ging which is very young young a few thousand years old .
so , indi@@ tive people are not sen@@ ti@@ mental , nor are cho@@ sen by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man manufac@@ tur@@ er who off@@ ers you an opportunity to con@@ fig@@ uring your car itself .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
the idea became really tan@@ gi@@ ble for them , you know that there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace sc@@ or@@ ps for computer ge@@ a@@ ks .
he talked about invisible da@@ um@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how anyone wanted to po@@ ison them up .
then invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and and they sk@@ et@@ ch , and lay sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think this person for actually a male , but they &apos;re not really .
but it doesn &apos;t expres@@ much enough the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck of the ice .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ &apos;s man@@ ic an@@ ger turned turned understanding to a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and in@@ mili@@ ty .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means the water rema@@ ins longer in me@@ a@@ dow .
now , lunch stands before and i think i &apos;m listening to here now before i &apos;m cho@@ ec@@ ted .
now we think our love of stories is ds on as a child on the parents our parents &apos; la@@ p .
i mean , i hope that we will be talking with this digital medium of art , and represent it proper@@ ly online .
so we think this is a situation in the software can actually build your hard@@ ware in a biological system .
even i had had work or ideas that came from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
they live in the dep@@ ths of con@@ gol@@ ese pri@@ at@@ ven@@ ation , and they &apos;re hard obser@@ obser@@ vation are very acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reas@@ on@@ ably as we can today .
and sure , we could have been ase these fire fire hy@@ dr@@ er all the time , and a lot of people do this .
it takes the same -- it would take , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s up to us to give these things .
who could have predi@@ cted double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
a few days later , we went to budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sitting around her sar@@ in .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories earlier to use time .
there are billions of people in the developing world who are not even a single city that would wel@@ come them .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be g in a single mar@@ um .
it could have every single image of have a impul@@ se that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of people or so forth .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student who introduced in@@ rel@@ hau@@ sti@@ requi@@ dem@@ ands on themselves .
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with them , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it ; they re@@ pair them .
our organis@@ m has invented a great way to make these kinds of in@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like they vy to disappe@@ ar .
you think that the com@@ pos@@ er put into the notes , just everything that he came up with it .
and they would say the vo@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ ists say , &quot; your white goes to church and and talks about god .
so when i look here , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that come out in this issue and the ath@@ le@@ tic species .
about a month after that , i went to see my daughter -- first first gra@@ ders , not lots of arti@@ stic talent ...
now i say , &quot; computers , now , take the the 10 percent of the sequences that came to my next pres@@ p@@ ture .
the al gore book , &quot; we have choice choice and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
while i was thinking about it later , i noticed cla@@ saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because they pro@@ j@@ ating ating an assu@@ mption forward that you see something that you recognize , un@@ ce@@ d@@ ented circle .
if i had been in fact , a sel@@ fish , then i would have written it it to a virus and rele@@ ased it into the room .
that means , at the moment you have to make sure that the rene@@ w@@ ables , , in sense , can , take over the entire net .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that this is not the gen@@ es@@ is -- this is based 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we &apos;re studying the world of marketing , of adverti@@ sing .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came from own individual .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the ab@@ und@@ und@@ ance of se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of these images have .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes that would pick them , one cr@@ one collapse .
the rul@@ ers of the old world had no concept based on on dna , but they had a concept of birth right .
that dis@@ stor@@ es and di@@ stor@@ all entire e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ reach@@ vable expec@@ tations in success .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
in the mean@@ time , in the same year in the bell lab@@ s were announ@@ ced to the next revolution , the next building block .
you can see here , he starts roll@@ ing , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
in the last 20 years alone there are are thousands thousand tons of ur@@ an alone on our fields in germany .
i think just like them , we sometimes play alone , and we feel boundar@@ ations of of our inner and ex@@ ternal worl@@ ds .
we need market cycle , we &apos;re controll@@ ing co2 , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade creates something that creates a price signal .
and these other things may have a lot of attra@@ ctive characteri@@ stics , and it &apos;s doing what you &apos;re going to do less attra@@ ctive .
you could just throw in a li@@ ter of al@@ l and then plant would be ru@@ ru@@ ined over years .
find out how you would survive . most of our players have main@@ ved preser@@ ved hab@@ its in the game .
you know , that &apos;s right to me , because that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be deli@@ cious .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t first believe .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel imag@@ us new and interesting things and show a big audience .
this mental ori@@ entation is the core of what i i think also the ted communities also to be enga@@ ged in this .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business so far , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be soon .
you may know that , if you &apos;re interested interested this little , from the austr@@ ali@@ an na@@ tive people .
but usually i have an acc@@ es@@ ory ire like sun@@ sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and a kind of stuff .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ ts of each he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could represent their brain .
so all the western rich are always exp@@ and@@ ed until they haven &apos;t done infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ ded .
this is not scienti@@ fically not exactly cor@@ rect , because we don &apos;t know how much away it &apos;s going to is@@ is@@ away .
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were cap@@ pped in in@@ dr@@ as thousands of years in an old bra@@ old book .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you could read when they google super@@ stru@@ ct .
so for example , i worked with people who are si@@ am@@ es@@ tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
one interesting fact about this kind of appli@@ cations is that you don &apos;t have to give people lots of in@@ struc@@ tions .
it &apos;t not , it &apos;s sense , child &apos;s stuff , we calcul@@ ated everything , never calcul@@ ated .
so no longer saving , spending , avoid , reduce , no management of de@@ bt , but intelligent waste .

and the nur@@ se thought about it , and he said in more tac@@ tical way , &quot; yeah , i think you &apos;re going to be well . &quot;
you see , if you type transpar@@ ency in google search for this -- this is one of the first images that appe@@ ars .
our cor@@ n@@ cham@@ ber is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not based of de@@ ro@@ dat@@ ing , but was because of de@@ lin@@ ing resources .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that re@@ a@@ der can connect around the world .
nobody had ever explor@@ ed inside of the w@@ re@@ ck . you had no resources to it it , so we developed the technology needs .
there &apos;s now cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the u.s. who &apos;s trying to make bio@@ fuel , gas gas from al@@ ga@@ e .
i realized at the time by ining the dots , that it &apos;s just about a great father going on .
i met people in all the habit@@ ats , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the boundar@@ ies of the possible .
but then , once we have all the points , you can play with it and play with color motion gravity and ro@@ movement .
and i want to think about the ways that democracy might look like , or could looked like , if we had had mothers mothers more .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , cri@@ ed , and we knew they had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
and so here is every book , and every world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i &apos;m to here here to the magic device in the device .
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , so they they qu@@ break out the liquid .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries .
we &apos;ve got technologies today of these fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ techniques to do what we call combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics .
they &apos;ve com@@ il@@ bled more information the world of war@@ craft on the internet than than any other top@@ ic in every other wi@@ ki in the world .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus oil , which are a hundred million fi@@ s a day .
the other half of the custom@@ ers go from the low opportunities , four dri@@ ves , to the 5@@ 6 car colors , lots of possibilities .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er said just before his death in his last interview : running each of my books killed killed me a little further . it was .
she caught the po@@ em on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took over it to the piece of paper .
these are energy far@@ , you talk about lots of square kilometers , a thousand times more area than a normal power plant .
this slide shows data of an analysis of us working about the performance of ris@@ c compared to the performance of a local area networks .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + one speak and us-@@ a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
so cities cities had to grow more and more because the farmers went to the cities and the cities had to go away to get their nutri@@ ents .
the truth is that nobody is that all of medicine knows what a good surge@@ on should be a doctor or res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant .
not change and technology thre@@ aten the integri@@ ty of eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . the ug@@ ly face of the rule .
after a four@@ -year-old and fil@@ ming sa@@ ga gli@@ tt a boat had still still to to the la@@ ke as a fishing boat .
my home state of al@@ ab@@ ama constantly pul@@ ls them to vot@@ ing when they &apos;re crimin@@ con@@ crimin@@ ged .
i don &apos;t mean ma@@ gi@@ cian and dra@@ g@@ ons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we we all had as children .
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service , and my ch@@ ent@@ ine asked me to a conversation in her office .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest@@ invest@@ ed in do@@ of companies doing amazing things and interesting interesting , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but to keeping even keeping ourselves in mental health ?
either it will become a classi@@ c cur@@ ve like this until something new comes in , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
i &apos;m going to work with him and do something completely different , something that makes people to think , challen@@ ging our world@@ world .
but i &apos;m going to go into that in a moment and &apos;m going to try to you that you also have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
we found 30 mistakes at the resource , and if we used the original sequence it would never have been possible up .
and they will been over@@ written more and over the course of the cent@@ u@@ ries more over@@ written by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can look and achieve re@@ ci@@ li@@ ation with its habit@@ its .
this is a real fl@@ y@@ fication control control , which dro@@ ps down to form a regular v like before .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad cards , but they &apos;ve used the gen@@ gen@@ ous son@@ gl@@ ines , or dre@@ w@@ am@@ them .
so let &apos;s take look at the wheel@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we didn &apos;t tried that , and what you can &apos;t sam@@ ple like that .
and he he set this this hel@@ met there , and in the co@@ operation operation with the museum , this went run .
we have not only in art art in fol@@ ting poetry , but also in great lies as well in science .
and i took the time i wa@@ sted most meaning@@ less things , hat@@ a , with people who mean something .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse remin@@ der of gut refle@@ ction than patient b .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing -- like this strange bear that &apos;s still brea@@ king .
and so the image ke is that we &apos;re generally doing better , obje@@ c@@ tively , and we feel worse .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consi@@ sts of two parts -- a sen@@ sing part and a re@@ acting ar@@ row .
we love farmers &apos;s markets . we love small family . we we talk about local food . we eat bi@@ o .
so what we first went for , , systems function calls , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
for years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also interested in research in gender difference al research .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man a design competition called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
we &apos;re making the past again that people can &apos;t understand , because the arr@@ a@@ ments have and are very low .
and what came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated software sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ character that was ever seen in a movie .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born to the birthday birthday , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch mar@@ ch in 19@@ 80 .
so we have these perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories that are proble@@ and frag@@ in many ways .
and we dro@@ ve in school distri@@ cts where companies are tra@@ in their way in im@@ pover@@ ished schools , all america .
and what , of course , , of course , intui@@ tively , and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of perception , and how does the cognitive process@@ ing work ?
you &apos;ve made bru@@ c@@ less civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always able to bring nutri@@ ents back .
i told him , &quot; well did you pulled political as@@ y@@ l , rather than having an operation to separate them ? &quot;
imagine that half the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments have already done this ; the other half don &apos;t yet .
it &apos;s not about making the standing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
the artist divi@@ des something to you , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to reduce our depen@@ dence old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that sti@@ it our world .
and that &apos;s meant for i me the outside the outside world , so i the real world again .
it &apos;s sel@@ addi@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s our wor@@ thy , and we have to really stop this .
they go through the spirit of this house , where they live , and they look at how many do@@ ors are there .
so , if i invi@@ them invi@@ te to eat and i you , that &apos;s free of ham@@ ks , it doesn &apos;t help you anything at all .
in our effort for democracy , we did our thing well , and i think we &apos;d well well our thing about the future .
but one important point he does is : whenever you choose to do one thing you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and yet , when i tried you in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , it didn &apos;t s@@ for fis@@ her@@ fish at all .
and for that purpose , people always come come and look at our experiment@@ test , sort sort of our level of content .
the artist of aging was prote@@ cted from some certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ m , right ?
and yet somehow you get the impres@@ sion that you should count what happens during that moments of life is our lives .
but the more i thought about his question , and i thought there could be something female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i know only know from my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
but most importantly , there &apos;s that between the perception of our in@@ satis@@ tions and our great inven@@ tions , there is a connection .
there was a energy , an in@@ ex@@ a@@ sti@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and of phan@@ ger .
and then he goes and cr@@ as@@ down into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and weird water plants .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ te and re@@ duced it to a little sum@@ mary ution .
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players ers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been comp@@ ani@@ ed it over the last three years since then .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ that , especially communities , is about the yl@@ pi@@ al rat@@ s .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees beyond his life support system .
in one of the connections , between a thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a man@@ ned paper fe@@ ct .
now they did this par@@ part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ten@@ cational system that where two things grew together .
we need to have that lie that kee@@ ps us the de@@ ception without which we can &apos;t even live .
and after experim@@ enting with different kinds of che@@ ese , i occur@@ red to me that this is a tar@@ ge@@ ted attack .
my third little story talks about my fellow in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ w@@ ies in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that meas@@ ures their success success of their predat@@ ors .
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z sen@@ this video that he fil@@ med in front of the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m has a x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ cell .
but or regul@@ arly in three dimensions where what &apos;s changing is light the light , not the position of the visual points .
but to see it in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors started right .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
we &apos;re going to be equi@@ pped for men and for women -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a shor@@ t-@@ si@@ ted view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
i was sho@@ cking in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
other medical profession@@ are fear as well , but emergen@@ cy cy care medicine is especially , because we only the patients just vol@@ a@@ ti@@ le .
now we have a conference here where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still at the year 2000 .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
and those two pictures ful@@ fill these two dem@@ ands -- shot from the same al@@ titude and the same kind of ligh@@ ination .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
very simple , you go in -- and i created this , called the power of the zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om around .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at university in al@@ as@@ ka has travel@@ ed to to another flat se@@ ke last winter .
now , the engineers of you , you to look at you and say , &quot; no , you &apos;re not doing that . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
here you have this mechan@@ ism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our lives .
but you know , this is really a serious business , because the stuff is cra@@ p , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
we don &apos;t have that so easy in real , this sense that there &apos;re staf@@ f in a finger@@ cu@@ ts .
my mother ma@@ i was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , even with two little girls .
and the more we &apos;re cho@@ ec@@ sel@@ pi@@ cky , the better we &apos;re to be able to practice the art of the decision .
and i learned in my little p@@ school in the si@@ sters res@@ iden@@ ce at the tor@@ onto general hospital , un@@ far from here .
and the ra@@ males broken english were tra@@ pped between people who had one thing together : they started re@@ happen .
we took our damage out to the hou@@ ow@@ ner@@ ship , where , not surpris@@ , got his much more attention than mine .
i think of it as a puzz@@ le of reality you can take different pieces and assem@@ ble them to create an alternative reality .
i dro@@ ve on it , and we made made in@@ hi@@ bi@@ s all over the southern southern southern sea , and in particular in ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we talked about nothing that has changed since the ancient indian e@@ po@@ s &apos;s ma@@ hab@@ har@@ har@@ a . &quot;
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swi@@ mming pool sha@@ formed hole and the thing .
if you finish the game off from the world bank , you get the ward of social social change , degrees in 2010 .
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires a lot more than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
and what she found was per 10 investment investment fund that off@@ ering the emplo@@ yer who took off by two percent participa@@ tion in two percent .
during the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er came in who dist@@ bo@@ ther@@ that the jan@@ it@@ or was in the cour@@ thou@@ room .
not every day will offer us a chance to save us the lives of a human being , but every day will off@@ ers us the opportunity to change one .
now we can form the second sentence , and can say , if wol@@ f sing@@ er right , he has no freedom of will .
ok , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single out@@ come and players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
over time , you also get dem@@ ands , you want to have a little more sp@@ in , or even taste a fine differences .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ ot@@ us , games , more ro@@ mor@@ games , the king@@ dom ly@@ di@@ were invented during a fam@@ ine .
this seemed the best way to tell stories my inner drive , with my need to create images , uni@@ te .
in this head , knowledge was re@@ wed and using these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was passed passed on .
development has stopped stopped ago in this industry , so it &apos;s not a surprise that some good concep@@ ts are around .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- everything was impossible at some point .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as this , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
now this communication now allo@@ allowed the reasons of communities , which , in a sense , were in the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tic .
for example , in california , in the next next five years , you &apos;re going to billion dollars on a death row the next five years .
i was 24 years old , and i was best best as a mon@@ str@@ ous p@@ ot tree during a sk@@ i paraly@@ zed .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical ima@@ ging , the image of water and the proje@@ ctions on it .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you , the problem is not a big sele@@ ction .
so a very , exciting process of how certain things happen and happen in a parts second areas these things .
and if you look for google with your smar@@ t@@ phone , you have more access and information than president clin@@ ton 15 years ago .
all these things come and start from a place , and come to me and start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
we also fle@@ w seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally all cor@@ ners of the world -- home to us .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabili@@ ze the human population .
the so-@@ called the perman@@ ice ice , five years old , or older , is almost like blood that came out of the body here .
and maybe somebody will never call god &apos;s name again if he ro@@ tat@@ es , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
this is what happens when you try to get get these inter@@ ted sources over we say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we listen@@ ed to our grandmother in the house .
but despite all these ti@@ de of work , there there are several cognitive fall that sort of of make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
the other thing that we want ask for is that companies around the world will help us con@@ fir@@ ma@@ of these a@@ e@@ ds .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma that one that we all think is right is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t get myself -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many muse@@ ums and these art .
the more possibilities there is , the more easier it is nothing to re@@ gre@@ t that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting for the ele@@ ction they make .
the other view of not , did anyone make ve deser@@ death for a crime , but : did we deser@@ ve to kill ?
and in many ways ways , , this is a symbol of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and all of the ones we in in the world .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
now the average age of our field is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
and if you fil@@ fil@@ ing oce@@ a@@ water cheap cheap and just filter it , you get get enough fuel for the rest of the rest of the life on the planet .
and so i can run through a evolution over millions of years in the computer a a few minutes or or more complicated cases , a few hours .
finally , do you read this carto@@ on , and and , a sophisti@@ cated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
not , if i think local e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , and the neighb@@ or thinks less e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
so much more natural natural , is in a po@@ t , but i kind of see right where &apos;s s@@ s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in there .
so , they sent half their civilization looking for a new world , so i take my billion billion hours a week .
that of you makes you do all the time , but it makes it un@@ conscious , , and it sort of intui@@ tively or par@@ par@@ tly as instin@@ c@@ tively .
at the end of he , he email email with this content : &quot; for the first time seven years i i dre@@ w something .
we had the vo@@ king age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re now descri@@ bing something called the cy@@ ber age .
i &apos;ve got cognitive feedback feedback , you &apos;ve pro@@ j@@ ger@@ ated what you want to see .
arch@@ a@@ a@@ ical cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve qui@@ ted in the pre-@@ industrial times .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i as@@ pi@@ red to get better into everything i pac@@ ka@@ le .
so in some way that we don &apos;t yet understand , these dro@@ p@@ ts have learned to learn how to down information .
now i &apos;m going to st@@ in this need@@ le in my skin and flo@@ it through it , until i &apos;ll te@@ ct it on the other side .
maybe we can &apos;t er@@ the human@@ ism a thought of of of er@@ just rational human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
for example , do you really concerned about me and you say , &quot; don you you fear you will never over@@ come this success ?
their h@@ unter@@ s smell the ur@@ ine of an animal of 40 steps distance and deter@@ mine what animal these bel@@ heard about .
and we also noticed that they were very professional ally constru@@ cted by people who had obviously had all the insi@@ ders &apos;s information .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens cle@@ clean the clo@@ g@@ ged gul@@ l@@ ys .
so doing he@@ ating the wir@@ zing slightly slightly and 13@@ -@@ thousand traffic lets suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resi@@ stance .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the the world have ga@@ ed in a really extraordinary and before un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented ex@@ tent .
typically , our system is based based on the idea that a particular an@@ atom@@ ic ex@@ lea@@ in with a particular identity .
this is just a small taste for the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s give us into our past and present .
but it &apos;s really always about lo@@ king access to finding a loo@@ king access like this , having a a play@@ ful de@@ ga@@ ings with this .
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as information in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
that was quite intui@@ tive , so everyone just expres@@ ses their wi@@ sh@@ es , his , his and what what moved them stop , then .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do this , and how much that would restri@@ freedom of speech .
it has to be comfortable for me in this and right now , otherwise otherwise can &apos;t &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch represents the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
we know that happiness means mostly being satis@@ fied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
so one of the intui@@ tions that they &apos;ve over the years is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
this thing has the ability to be in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you did , you all wouldn &apos;t know what this is about .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted it . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how come your fish taste ta@@ taste so well ? &quot;
and when they do it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . this is an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
so i immediately called up the online copy of 2009 , and expe@@ cting me to find a speak@@ er contribu@@ tion here .
and you can approach him , and he will open up to jump them through as you can see in this picture .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i could pre@@ te at an event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants wei@@ gh about four times more than we humans .
if the re@@ pi@@ ust that you get is a very high energy ce , only the keep people can keep it .
i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of the kinds of gender var@@ ie@@ ties , who don don &apos;t respond to the male or female standard .
sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , there was such a great fam@@ ine that the king of king of ly@@ di@@ ya decided to be a crazy idea .
income income distribution will make sure it &apos;s all better -- not just the just the poor -- because all these sele@@ choice pla@@ pla@@ ins us .
if you ask this question , you think that people in california california have be happ@@ ier when you live , say , in o@@ hi@@ o .
the artist divi@@ des you in a portra@@ it , something with something that you &apos;ll be familiar with when you look at this work over and over again .
when we started stu@@ research stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , completely un@@ known about what was the meaning and purpose of that design .
around christ@@ mas , around i around at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , i was a billion tons of coal lam@@ b .
it &apos;s already being working on a ju@@ di@@ cial that management are allowed to participa@@ te , and it &apos;s also going being working on an ex@@ ternal legal system .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking problems in a very long run , but eventually finally over@@ come them .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like each at@@ at@@ om out there is out there , a sen@@ sor and a dri@@ er .
and one of the things we introduced at the bi@@ b@@ ou@@ d university was to make a main listen@@ er .
and those , the worse was where the pain was at the very end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ , where the individual images start and end by by cting them se@@ am@@ less@@ ly .
is there a chance that politicians would that the country would generally take a fin@@ fund like seriously and do based on politics ?
it &apos;s because you &apos;re bus@@ y with other things , you &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i mar@@ ry now ?
we &apos;re more like the symbo@@ lic , at the level level of meaning@@ ings , which we &apos;re also dealing with , as a shape .
i wor@@ e my pre@@ y down to where i met on the front door and my ene@@ my and the belo@@ ved dog .
and as we do today , in 2011 , we may trust our governments , but right right we spend forever em@@ it@@ ted forever .
it &apos;s great fun to make music this way , and then you as the audience has experienced how the music communicate alive .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet that is filled filled at 5,000 times more energy than we consu@@ me every year .
if i ask you a question , raise because i &apos;m blind , just your hand if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
take the swi@@ t@@ ches around a pul@@ smo@@ du@@ wer , which is , put it , and you made a little blind blind .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t actually give su@@ i@@ ci@@ cide seemed to be really ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted by their tal@@ ents .
and just just intui@@ tively access on the left , and then hope me there &apos;s no sugar in there , the s@@ alt is just accor@@ d@@ ingly .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of carbon co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons -- 25 million tons a day into the oceans .
but after all , it &apos;s about interpre@@ ting the world , and how it can be made on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how the protein will evol@@ ve .
oh my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re soon to the 70 percent rate of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
to give you an example , in the most extreme , we can make a program that emer@@ ges from random in@@ struc@@ tions .
they put us down to build things that were bigger than us , bri@@ d@@ ges , one rock after another .
and finally , i can explo@@ up the whole sequence by ben@@ ing the volu@@ me offen@@ ers to the left .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been repor@@ a lot lot about people sus@@ pe@@ ct that the mo@@ s@@ sad is the main organization behind it .
and one of them is , despite all our achie@@ vement , one billion people in the world are going to bed hun@@ gry every day .
you might say it &apos;s a pres@@ cri@@ ption for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bar@@ k or meat meat bee@@ ds .
i &apos;ll get the whole over@@ view , can now on this , and i can say , just just show me all cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we &apos;re finding a number of extraordinary technologies that are available available .
anyway , we found that both digital war@@ war@@ heads actually head@@ ing one and the same goal , but from different direc@@ tions .
le@@ go , basically took the con@@ cre@@ te building block , took the building block of the world , and then made it into a building block for our imagination .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
but what we do is we can be each one of them , including me sending out into the world with the cla@@ im .
they really go go through and create a frame in which this can be wide , because we need support for all sides .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion organized pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later in a year during the summer .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything goes well , the kni@@ fe is held by my m@@ ere physical magne@@ tis@@ m .
there &apos;s once product language , the practical fun@@ ctions , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal@@ thetic aspe@@ cts .
well , it seems to me , this is going to be theme , or should at least the most interesting political debate should pur@@ pur@@ su@@ over the next few years .
it &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal pain@@ ful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe it will never go back to these hei@@ ghts .
all these people teach us that there are other ways of existence , other ways of thinking , there are other ways of ori@@ entation on earth .
he can bring new characters into the scene by li@@ f@@ er from the table who showing this character .
then he took a s@@ ck be@@ er , and he off@@ ered my sister one thing , and she as@@ sum@@ ed , and then they off@@ use one .
they gave somebody least a fe@@ a@@ ther under their nose , and when they moved , they didn &apos;t dig them yet .
and there &apos;s an idea that if we ban@@ ned those who make mistakes out of of medicine that we rema@@ ins a safe system .
just if you take these wind ir@@ y , you cho@@ at@@ p , ster@@ ili@@ ze and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant plant trees .
and peter talks , &quot; nei@@ of the kids are invest@@ ed time at being the o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
do we really believe that what we what we need to do without impro@@ ving an institution that can act on the name of all of us ?
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at at least in every ma@@ book for children since the 195@@ 0s .
the ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , you know advanced technology , and magic is not longer from one another .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but i can impro@@ impro@@ v@@ ate or shor@@ ter it it mean@@ dinner .
h@@ ein@@ rich needs to wait for all this , , because he actually actually a different biological age , just because of the time point of his birth .
for the first time in history , you hear people people call this us us the , a geni@@ us -- instead of him having a geni@@ us .
and when i said &quot; no , &quot; she hu@@ g me again . when i said &quot; yes , &quot; she let me alone .
now a human being min@@ less@@ less@@ call call a child , could reach to con@@ stra@@ them them to give ideas with ideas .
do you feel about it ? because looking at just one centi@@ ch distance -- i don &apos;t feel comfortable with that notion at all .
if we think about the wei@@ gh@@ s to the pi@@ way , our then our entire earth will so@@ on@@ er , or later a pe@@ ac@@ me@@ tery .
the call for gam@@ ers to sign up , we made almost like a jer@@ ry y-@@ gro@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer &quot; movie .
and this is a news that we need to use this guy scale on se@@ mic log@@ ari@@ mic cur@@ ves in the field of technology .
we do more in game worl@@ ds . i mean good at the context of motivation motivation of doing something something , inspired by working with each other .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lot back and forth , we &apos;ve achie@@ ved some things .
there were people who thought we would have comple@@ ted these oceans really well and transpor@@ ted the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a on the planet .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to wit@@ n@@ n@@ esses from not less than a mass migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds and online play@@ environments . &quot;
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , maybe we &apos;ll get a factor re@@ duc@@ ing by a factor three , or even by a factor 6 .
but always on the ed@@ ges of your skills , so you have to go hard ke , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
and just by the way , the largest in@@ sur@@ ance to population explosion is a better education and diet around the world .
today , i want to give you what i used to trans@@ to musical musical , which i interpre@@ t , , to you , into a verb@@ al language .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything an orche@@ str@@ a from then as an un@@ play@@ able .
that &apos;s why all of you who are here and curious curious , in fact , people who have a tra@@ ature you can &apos;t learn .
and if it f@@ ought through the system , and this leaves leaves , the water is clean than as it came in .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process process using this particular information structure , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
we &apos;re using programs now to make the computers much faster , so we &apos;re able to make these processes even faster .
there &apos;s a lot of things about it , especially if you think you &apos;re working working in a hospital that had only had 14 patients a night at that time .
because i &apos;m in order to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale of time .
and we just started to ask a relatively simpl@@ -@@ crazy story , where could you use a memory meaning@@ sation today ?
so we have a game , the next world game a bigger , higher ent@@ dest@@ gets than just oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way that you , the better you know your fish , you love the fish the more .
players always believe that an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try it in same way .
the third thing i learned -- while the inner watch off off , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; ... &quot; down .
we should over@@ mit that half of us spend an hour a day with games until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
and if you watch bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at the game , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human sal@@ mon , dance and ritu@@ als .
and then we even tried to bring that back to the acade@@ mic world , but somehow it &apos;s not there that there .
we can start to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility on the island , ask ask , because you can manage bur@@ den .
one that i fir@@ m@@ ly believe about is that if you take your chance , you take risks , you are opportunities in these risks .
and what happens if you play a piece today , which had origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
every language is like an ol@@ d-@@ d-@@ forest forest in mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
you see , it just takes a human to show you how to mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
so min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , they can hold the ten@@ sion .
sol@@ d@@ at : the h@@ ul@@ ul@@ c@@ -@@ ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds pounds about different ter@@ rain for various ter@@ rain for many hours .
he trans@@ ated ated the ero@@ chs in a different , , as he saw them , as they were doing at this moment .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wir@@ ges -- these gold wir@@ es .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-@@ being , and i hope i gave you a sense of how difficult it is .
i others get for you . don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks to you . &quot;
and the answer is , you expect us to call the doctor to the next morning and ask a change in the cri@@ ption .
and the next ent@@ ry we got was saying , &quot; i went over there , found the g@@ arb@@ age ton behind the house .
so i suggest@@ ed that governments create new areas that provide enough city place and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
or photos like this -- dark and color@@ ful ful at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep a reali@@ stic level .
is it logi@@ cal that somebody should be expected that he &apos;s afraid of doing the work he feels prof@@ on ?
my circle started back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class@@ class .
this is , i think , is so deep in our water supply , that it wouldn &apos;t come any sense to question .
so i think we &apos;re from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene , terms &apos;re even one step further than the acade@@ mic world .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10@@ th , we knew that the machine would work , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
the impli@@ sion of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a sub@@ plac@@ ement of well-@@ being .
he had just heard a performance o of bee@@ tho@@ ven first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony and came behind the stage to imagine me .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i fund a company that , surpris@@ ingly , tra@@ ws the nuclear approach .
and then they ask them how to do their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;ll understand some of plants .
sha@@ e@@ ans , pri@@ est , so-@@ called knowledge wat@@ ri@@ ers , were extra@@ ally for this to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ im@@ pl@@ , the the like that .
it &apos;s conf@@ uses us , course , because because on the one hand , the new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook and and so on .
sometimes people say to me , i look like i &apos;m d@@ ressed &apos; &apos; or that i say that i remember them their se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
the amazing amazing about this is that this kind of stor@@ ing information over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years where they came rema@@ ined the same .
there &apos;s no question that is a little bit better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow , which is more choice better than some sele@@ ction .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i didn &apos;t know if i had just dre@@ am@@ ed this crazy contra@@ ct or actually writing it .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this sp@@ inning mass , then you have to replace this with performance electr@@ on@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemistry .
and how we use it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps the memory itself for us .
computers ha@@ cking , and then it will always like this in the media , yeah , the ha@@ cker break somewhere and cla@@ al data and so forth .
she knew that in such moment , she could only do one thing , and that was -- in her words -- the ture like like de@@ de@@ vil weather .
the cloud is again , a cloud of ima@@ points , in the same way a real cloud is a cloud out of particles .
here &apos;s a back@@ bone forma@@ tion to put that into the . . you know all the wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki in the world .
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me , and then she said , &quot; well . um . um . um . &quot;
at this point , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different cell types , that are together as a single organis@@ m .
at the same time , i was also interested in space science , which was the science fi@@ ction influence from my childhood .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cur@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find out they &apos;re us@@ eless .
an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result that is so positive that they didn &apos;t know know that it was possible at all .
on the y-@@ axis are a few good things : bio@@ diversity diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of your country , the water supply .
and after terror@@ ism , of course , the ra@@ cing tion and decades of ra@@ c@@ cally motiv@@ ated sur@@ mission and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who was in las las v@@ eg@@ as did his show in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
now , this is just one example of how we feel the city today in a way we couldn &apos;t a few years ago .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , transi@@ st@@ or allows us to build much more complex cy@@ cles , a stone after another .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
some of you will remember , it was playing as it@@ al@@ y against fr@@ ance , and then at end of zi@@ an , the head@@ push .
and if we &apos;re just here here in frank@@ fur@@ t , i &apos;ll remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ck institute for brain research .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to start a big test project with a hundred un@@ its in the developing world .
and no , it didn &apos;t coo@@ ok the fish and it &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least the way you and i understand it .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ moment -- that i &apos;m married married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste is being distribu@@ ted by our fish is not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
but the ab@@ han@@ is by a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , disaster .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism , was the social nor@@ m and local mand@@ ar@@ in was the most important person .
my response to that was drawing , and painting ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , robots , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps and something like that .
and then saw me in my face and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still doing crazy because of conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
and not just in art , even in the fol@@ k where , in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories it comes back again .
as@@ sum@@ ing i said , by few changes in your genes , could have a better memory -- pre@@ cise , more more pre@@ cise and faster .
so to tell you about this ten@@ sion , i i have to first know that that i &apos;m a big fan of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
when i put up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court , there was an el@@ der@@ , black man king the jan@@ it@@ or in the court .
the re@@ el@@ ing power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians cians who understood him , who recogni@@ zed his talent and ei@@ attention ed it .
that &apos;s why you have to dep@@ end on these sources , you have a way to get the energy times when it &apos;s not available .
we have a justice system in this country that they treat treat much better if they &apos;re rich rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent .
when i was another kid , there was the future , somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what was going to happen in the year 2000 .
we have a very difficult dis@@ sa@@ tions today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in her po@@ cket costs about a million times less , and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
it tou@@ ched something very deep of me , identity , the ability of each individual , to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective of hope .
so , it turns out you &apos;re take each one of the 17 var@@ ie@@ ties to take the full moon and you &apos;re sing@@ ing to you in a different key .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest ice mass , you can see at the top of new la@@ kes that were gl@@ aci@@ ers a few years ago .
when hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and you buy one that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
these are some kids who came to a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try it out and i took a video of it .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists in the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of earth , could never have dre@@ am@@ ed such lux@@ ury goods .
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es right now .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to use magic rather than kill magic .
here , on the left left here is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , hou@@ se-@@ of-@@ natur@@ fi@@ ber , which is is , but she &apos;s been there for a long time .
thank you very much . just to ter@@ ra@@ power little better -- first time , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
and today i had time to show you some of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
when we turn off the dies@@ el , you don &apos;t longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that causes a kind of in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the net .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
because we ultimately talk about we need more hope , more commit@@ ment , more commit@@ ment to pass in a complex world .
cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where the vac@@ cin@@ zation vac@@ mas@@ ers dro@@ down .
so the people who can see a prote@@ cted area and benefit from insi@@ that that allows to res@@ their a@@ standards .
they give them + every day they give order on about gra@@ gra@@ of phosp@@ phosp@@ hor@@ us every day , and you have to two gra@@ ms phosp@@ hor@@ us every day .
and in a ally , we just want to do this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , what the product is called , but also as an a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
it was ared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ floor without a camera and without t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
can please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come together with the man i know you found him now .
the reason they &apos;re often different kinds of sur@@ gical interven@@ tion is because they thre@@ at@@ ze our social categ@@ ories .
i can now ori@@ ent this mental model of action , sel@@ ec@@ tive , in@@ form , tran@@ sa@@ trans@@ trans@@ fer to an interaction system .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the 25 percent rate to 25 percent liter@@ acy in the past 1@@ 30 years .
you read in the letters , journ@@ als , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ ers themselves .
if you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , you think slightly that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separ@@ ated , just much as we see see see .
i &apos;m going to show you very brie@@ fly about three games that i designed to try and try people to ep@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies in their own future .
just different economic changes have influ@@ enced it at all , and we need to go from ra@@ pid increase to reduce and a redu@@ ction to zero .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que that helps you to deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making over@@ la@@ ps , it &apos;s con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
so we thought that we would embra@@ ce this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this problem .
and that , of course , , also , where you start and look at and you say , okay , now i just look into the inner itself .
the reason is i &apos;m create digital tools and processes to help teams to create cars , video games and visual effects .
we teach our students to of these technologies , with special focus on how these can be used to solve the grand challenges of humanity .
why we look for the vac@@ ation that we &apos;re for is a problem that be@@ have with a ele@@ ction between the two kinds of self .
i have friends who make big , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends who make little indepen@@ dence movies like me .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want you to ry . &quot;
because this was completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey was funny idea , his argument looked at five million times .
it pri@@ le@@ le@@ does not necessarily necessarily the biggest the largest , the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and even the bri@@ gh@@ test .
more importantly , are physi@@ cally , so you can only move them like blocks blocks only reach out your hands and out .
these are over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule of defined structure ever ever created by humans .
if you think it &apos;s on the left side ja@@ zz and that , on the right side of s@@ wing , you please cla@@ p .
if you think the left display is s@@ wing , and the ad on on right ja@@ zz , you cla@@ p into your hands .
a child who is born in new del@@ hi , can expect wait to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world , 100 years ago .
we knew by a mechan@@ ism of the hom@@ ologist re@@ combin@@ ation , which is biology is using to re@@ pair dna that can put these pieces together .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up po@@ ll is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find .
the most beautiful thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that they surro@@ them in the everyday life and that you don &apos;t learn in school .
ad@@ ding ding opportunities into people &apos;s lives , inevi@@ t@@ makes increasing expec@@ tations tations people have about how good these possibilities will be .
and it conne@@ cts us all together together into something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s also be able to evol@@ ving faster than we &apos;ve been so far .
and it &apos;s about explor@@ vering a city by looking at which places have positive or nega@@ tively t@@ we@@ ed .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , tr@@ at@@ mana@@ gers on youtube and i look at youtube youtube videos .
groups like anony@@ mous have gone up over the last 12 months and have become one of the main ac@@ ers in the field of online attac@@ ks .
again , people of different skin color , which are successful an@@ atom@@ ic ali@@ ties of an@@ atom@@ ic occu@@ pa@@ tions , again , successful .
there were about 20 bar@@ ches of about 20 in@@ ches , black d mouth mouth , sub@@ sub@@ of the t@@ bar@@ an .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation that i talked about .
for me , that means time to think and talk about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ , , who will never be at ted .
i believe that if you train your staf@@ f , to avoid risks , you &apos;re going to ask the whole company to get a profit .
this is actually not necessary , because every coffee machine &apos;s machine has actually has sophisti@@ cated technology than most of the lab , that &apos;s really the case .
it &apos;s not a death when you mel@@ melt ; it &apos;s not end , it &apos;s an progress in your path along the life cycle .
we constru@@ cted the pieces so that we could just de@@ ct them with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
so the question i want to ask you is if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you can see they &apos;re not going to continue forever .
they started educ@@ ating speci@@ alists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and cap@@ turing information .
so i sig@@ ned the ab@@ and@@ oned pa@@ pers and a am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce and res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stan@@ ts , and i brought them home .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom@@ e brand , but i often see myself the interface of dark glamour and g@@ able fly .
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ our , rema@@ ins , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed to food . &quot;
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s being being used , and every time it makes the over@@ all picture bigger than the sum of the fil@@ es .
as you can see , it gro@@ gro@@ ws the dark blue , , is is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in summer .
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ ze e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print that &apos;s useful .
and most importantly , with ad@@ ction to sexual re@@ production that continu@@ the genome , the rest of the body is be dis@@ pri@@ ed .
it uses each one of us and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , and it stands for ori@@ ented , sel@@ ec@@ tive , in@@ form , tran@@ sa@@ tive .
they really came up do about there , because this leads to a extra@@ on@@ toler@@ ant society , which le@@ th@@ al violence has not not been obser@@ ved .
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , yes , sort sort of air prin@@ ting gun that sho@@ ots about as far , two centi@@ ches or something .
my ja@@ w was down , and and after re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i would the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
every note , every phr@@ ase ase makes sense because i feel it myself , because it jum@@ ps out of my own personally .
so the circle closed between my existence as a science science fi@@ ction fan , then a child , and the imple@@ ment into reality .
the question was simple , calcul@@ this was two thou@@ thousand 2006 , started the first cont@@ acts with the island , but just just calcul@@ ting it .
so to this day , they &apos;re regi@@ ster@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , but the education of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od education is very extraordinary .
it &apos;s not about ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our res@@ ist for greater food , better food , unique food .
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more if they use a ec@@ -@@ map or a card of credit rather than on bar@@ ash ?
so , for example , designers with no experience what@@ so@@ experience in electr@@ onic things , that started playing with li@@ ck@@ leb@@ its as a material .
that means i can just trans@@ mit an intui@@ tive tive , human action , to software , and make the software a more user friend@@ ly .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ cra@@ fing player plays 22 hours a week , sort of a part@@ -@@ time job .
and speaking &apos;re talking about bacteria , you you realize that every one of us in our gut more bacteria than than cells in the rest of our body ?
i colle@@ cted a little team of people around me for the box , was not &quot; an in@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about what a body becomes human human , so that it &apos;s a different right than fe@@ als life .
the her@@ od@@ ot@@ us after 18 years , fam@@ ine didn no better , so the king decided to use a final cu@@ cu@@ be .
i &apos;m pro@@ gressi@@ ve political , i &apos;m de@@ f@@ ding people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit mit , it makes me nervous .
i went to a clean room with new si@@ li@@ li@@ -@@ sli@@ ces , and i re@@ ed for 100 hours on all the big devices .
we &apos;ve come to a point which is anal@@ o@@ g at the time when one-@@ cell organisms have evolved to multi-@@ cell organisms .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that off@@ off@@ ered people something between two to 5@@ 9 different fund .
a whole re@@ mi@@ x community shot from the ground that made it from a sil@@ b jo@@ ke to something we can all participa@@ te in .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful thing over the country ?
this is a photograph of actual design software that we work on , where you actually sit down and design new species at the computer .
the hard step is to build the first re@@ actor to find more billion , the regular and the place place that actually buil@@ ds first of one .
and i have 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white swe@@ ater , which i &apos;m trying to keep in air@@ por@@ ts from security sper@@ m .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist because they don &apos;t play with bo@@ ground pi@@ le@@ ers , but with these little strange particles .
in these opportunities , the po@@ em came in in and in@@ t@@ act on the paper -- but back@@ wards from the last word the first word .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws , which deter@@ mine that you can &apos;t be dist@@ ur@@ bing exi@@ sting part@@ ners .
the fis@@ her@@ ies of these color@@ ful bar@@ were very productive , and the fis@@ her@@ men lived good of them and deser@@ ved very well on average .
i call it as that &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big big -- climate climate crisis dying , water and energy problems -- we already have .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who try to re@@ find their parents , in some cases cases , they haven &apos;t seen it for a decade .
this childhood ritual is brought back . you have to go out and take a picture of a flo@@ wer in a chap@@ ter .
but it was still a divi@@ against the other volunte@@ ers to reach to the responsible main man and figure out what our tas@@ ks would be .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to leave you with your way , fail@@ ing is is an alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
there was a time when i was a boy , you you could have tele@@ phone ven@@ or or that wanted to to as long as he came from ma bell .
but in the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to most best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not not enough .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man who had been held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
and these are not the characteri@@ stics of old media , and they &apos;re also bar@@ ely meet ting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the conversation of the future .
so you really have to look in the detail if i want to make something use or intui@@ tively hand@@ hab@@ able , which means that means the core .
so , it goes , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm i &apos;m just going to do a little stick .
in and again , a letter is going down down for me -- and the i@@ pad knows from gps where i live -- it &apos;s really add@@ add@@ res@@ ted to me .
i resi@@ ted to a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman prin@@ ter was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital .
and the commercial device costs about five 10 thousand euro@@ s up@@ ward or something like that sa@@ pen@@ ders by fif@@ th .
they put their hands together and started sing@@ ing : al@@ la@@ h al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god . god .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and great games .
so i talked about you@@ gen@@ ver@@ ess@@ ness and education , and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and un@@ calcul@@ ated .
and when i tell someone , let me s@@ s@@ s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , he &apos;s going to be on the right to think where what &apos;s in there .
i &apos;m now about about ment@@ basically this whole environmental debate , world years , clu@@ clu@@ b@@ -@@ of-@@ ro@@ me to quality .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed to so infin@@ itely difficult .
and one of the things that i thought really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
then it goes into the past , and so i can over@@ bridge very elegan@@ t waiting ning times on the computer , for example , if i know this phenomenon .
and of course , it brea@@ ks to you to listen to the heart that in rever@@ se , the one-@@ students were told they &apos;re just cient .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british col@@ om@@ bia , and i believed these fore@@ sts are there to be ger@@ o@@ ed .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , as the one you saw earlier who &apos;s moving with others , completely syn@@ chr@@ c .
and what we found was that the more f@@ on@@ ds were off@@ , that , in fact , the participa@@ tion rate was lower .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it &apos;s what we &apos;re &apos;re dealing with something that would actually actually com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion , but it &apos;s not the case .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s formed like a spr@@ ing@@ board , and it &apos;s above the edge .
these are the kind of thoughts that can can get somebody get to drin@@ king 9 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , g@@ g@@ in . and i don &apos;t want that .
and i , up in the other picture i have a a lec@@ ture in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen at the medical museum in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion .
we &apos;ve all heard about fe@@ en and n@@ y@@ mp@@ hen , how many people outside india know your indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying objects are lies the same explosion of choice .
imagine a motor station , the cl@@ w , cl@@ om , bo@@ om , bo@@ w , cla@@ w , cla@@ w , cla@@ p .
people who have never for@@ vot@@ ed have never felt immediately with their body , as it &apos;s like to make a sound .
while chimpanze@@ es are big , great , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing guys , the bon@@ o@@ bo society is led by em@@ power@@ ing fe@@ males .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , nobody &apos;s built the purpose of a wall .
secon@@ d-@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact of my gar@@ den@@ mp to the environment , and also the one to my pur@@ se .
the reason for this is that freedom is good at itself , valuable sense sense , an un@@ sustainable assu@@ mption for human human .
it was a beautiful fish , ta@@ ta@@ cious , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , dur@@ rich , a be@@ selling selling on the men@@ u .
and this is something that gro@@ ws through the complexity that people use it , and the benefits of the user will and larger with the app@@ lic@@ ation .
so now i have a new generation of programs coming out through combin@@ ations of programs that have come closer to the pres@@ something closer than others .
and to make sure nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ e@@ ve or comes out of it , i &apos;ll just put my wr@@ ist right here .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ gers , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ 2000 .
and during this gather@@ ing , we have this gather@@ ction just the same as it was always , just we ad@@ ded a small thing .
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , that gives us a good picture about how they made that .
and it &apos;s just nur@@ mal sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct li@@ li@@ li@@ , production of chemicals or fuel fuel production vac@@ acc@@ ine production and so on .
we &apos;ve now got 10 million projects projects , to clim@@ b 10 10 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery now to the ger@@ man web .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ , that &apos;s what the fish fe@@ eding .
whenever i go along the way , and whenever i open the medical si@@ s@@ in@@ set , you &apos;ll see ban de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
that means for a child who has spent up the achie@@ ving of of the grand@@ osity has spent the most of his life with the pres@@ pe of stories .
i feel like i was us@@ hed under@@ water , and finally finally reach@@ ked down and pulled my head so i can brea@@ the . &quot;
because while you &apos;re bus@@ y making clear that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predi@@ predi@@ , , man is quite happy .
so both of them , physical cloud in the sky , and something at the top you can go , like lon@@ london &apos;s new mountain top ap@@ top .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california justice that that cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers so two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
you also had to learn , so not a small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it search c@@ essi@@ ve and , of course .
next , the successful civil rights movement came , where we saw people like so@@ ch@@ y truth , which is about it , &quot; am i a woman ? &quot;
i wo@@ the that that i might find anything else i might might wanted to , once i was going to get to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
these are the people who , at least offi@@ cially ac@@ mit@@ ted on the website , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ y@@ .@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ or@@ g website .
together with il@@ m , we created the guy of liquid metal there , and the success depen@@ ded entirely on how that effect would happen .
in south africa , people understood that the ra@@ cing re@@ cing is ven@@ tion is not over@@ come without the will@@ ing@@ ness to the truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
stu@@ x@@ net was like a lab that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ff@@ ed it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
you &apos;ve also t@@ ys &apos;s little example of where he showed a little evolution in the con@@ vol@@ tion program right in front of your eyes .
one in three male black black between 18 and 30 is in cu@@ on@@ dy , in prison , rele@@ on on cur@@ ren@@ , or condi@@ tional ex@@ posi@@ position .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts on cent@@ fu@@ ge and power plants from our cli@@ base . &quot;
and this has become a gigan@@ tic network of very good ones , yes , infra@@ struc@@ tural centers that have repres@@ ented all over the world .
in my contra@@ ct , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ condu@@ ors of the state se@@ est@@ ship and the police and des@@ sen@@ ors were consi@@ der@@ ing .
and why ? because you understand tri@@ an@@ gles and sec@@ ure self-@@ rein@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
but our system is not only being sha@@ ped by questions that have dealing with ra@@ on@@ city , but it &apos;s also dis@@ placed by poverty .
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ im@@ ie , but we can move the software dna , change things quite dra@@ matically .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an effective -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of an sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient .
these notes are about of accu@@ rate or un@@ accu@@ rate as a verb@@ al , if very seem@@ ingly com@@ b@@ st pre@@ cise , descri@@ ption of a landscape .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , was born ma@@ for three months , so she was born on jun@@ e , 19@@ 80 .
so you have to deal with this , which means that that , and not only do change it change it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and if you think this &apos;s crazy , you know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version that was looked at four million times .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ zing , and we don &apos;t know that either , because that &apos;s how the world world works now .
he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he smo@@ hed the wo@@ , and made sure i wasn &apos;t going to sell .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat , in china are expe@@ cting for food that they stay as long as you &apos;re look for the toi@@ let .
and he sp@@ ends two weeks of the thought thought that he mis@@ sed the ability to day over day to have a great par@@ king lot .
because we asked these people about their gut mirror , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
evolution has been on a top@@ top@@ theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of an doctor &apos;s top@@ ic .
and all right , i just want to encoura@@ ge you , in the sense that you can be a quie@@ t t a little crazy and you can have a vision .
like , for example , a night works , or why the do@@ ors are open el@@ ev@@ ator , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
ordinary ol@@ Ã© ! standards for you , all of this , just for you have the m@@ ere human love and self-@@ dness , for being there .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments where they almost su@@ sed it .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen a performance like this in your life .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world , to the magic , fun , the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
and it shows others their er@@ r@@ ors , not to m@@ ere , but in a lo@@ ving , , suppor@@ tive way so that all of them are benefit .
looking at looking at one of these sum@@ mar@@ ies i can go into time magazine magazine &quot; people of the year , and all see together .
fish mot@@ very meant countries that were already 100,000 fish already start the industrial fishing me of this fairly ug@@ ly ship is called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and none of them has some really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property , and it &apos;s just our belief in it &apos;s &apos;s a stron@@ ger impact in us .
and according her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they survi@@ ved these fam@@ ine for 18 years by eating eating on one day and playing the next one .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions of whether this means about doing all the tas@@ that i tell you and getting a good note in my class .
let me tell you one very clear . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
and then it was also about it , yes , .@@ k , who are we , what do we want , what do we want , what do we want to share with ?
most of them , the fish that little dots there on the ru@@ b@@ ble , the de@@ cep@@ tive pi@@ le , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
but something of like do@@ o@@ f@@ es like n solar pen@@ um , which sort of comes a hundred wat@@ ts out of the square meter , which was a to@@ y .
that means that every at@@ om at the same time is in two different places , which means at the same time that the whole whole of metal is in two different places .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier at working hard than if we rela@@ x or doing nothing .
to this day , all world of war@@ cra@@ ft@@ players together together together spent 5@@ 9@@ 3 million years to solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
because in the part , it can lead lead the collapse of the hori@@ zon , can mean so easy that you accept the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
we &apos;re all moving to a world where technology &apos;s forces of technology can get closer closer and approach magic and technology .
this is a 18 in@@ ch ch hu@@ t@@ need@@ le . it &apos;s very , very spi@@ p , and i &apos;m going to ster@@ ili@@ ze you a little bit first .
i &apos;m saying it out , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here , -- -- it &apos;s highly likely that my biggest success behind me .
the united states has incredible ways to allow people to be those they are without having having to change around the state &apos;s will .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans of three million whe@@ els of radiation .
but web videos have en@@ allowed us to all or all of our creative activi@@ ties ties can be in@@ well famous in a part of the culture of our world .
it was like standing under the impact of an invisible ar@@ z@@ ne@@ i a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my game .
one day she ste@@ pped out of ally to a arm@@ band ma@@ os and for that trans@@ mission , she had to go a heavy work camp for seven years .
the recogni@@ tion will be slow in the united states , not not a question , but in the u.@@ dom it &apos;s happening happening now and it &apos;s happening in other countries right now .
because the truth is that , if you break the gold@@ fish glass , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paraly@@ sis .
none of these extreme decisions bel@@ on@@ gs to decisions that people would re@@ com@@ men@@ d if we care about their future financial well-@@ being .
all we eat , every ri@@ ce lo@@ , every bran@@ ch of pe@@ ter@@ sil@@ ie , every ro@@ el , was changed by the people .
this is a question that is really moving to me as a designer designer , but also in the field of the research us@@ ability , and all of things in the field of user .
like if you do a qu@@ est for pictures , where you type sent@@ ences and the text of the website con@@ tains a lot of information about what image this is .
you can google it , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of grid , but the upp@@ er res@@ pir@@ atory caus@@ ing the brea@@ thing ways .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples , the mi@@ d-@@ 197@@ 9 , just the same day , exactly the same moment , each one &apos;s a baby -- okay .
he spra@@ yed stor@@ es on the sides of the cal@@ on kni@@ fe , and when it was completely fro@@ zen , he ama@@ zed a dog with it .
now , this surface story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we face facing in the mil@@ len@@ nia .
direct adverti@@ sing , not for the company pu@@ ma per se , but for now in this this company to success@@ make these products .
in the hand@@ n , the cour@@ thou@@ ium was full of people who were gry that we talked about skin color , was about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
are you not afraid that they &apos;re writing writing your whole life and and do you create a book that anyone anyone car@@ about in the world ? never again ?
i sta@@ yed up too long one night and thought my god , if a ju@@ can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces .
but shor@@ recent thing has happened in my life and my career that got me to re@@ think my relationship to this work .
and occasi@@ on@@ ally , the wife car@@ r r to me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks comes to the city . we want to talk about it .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you &apos;ve to go out and with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ &apos;s pictures of natural objects .
i &apos;m an lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll click here , where all gave me all in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong is mentioned .
and &apos;s known known by so@@ cr@@ rates that it believed he had a demon@@ er who re@@ f@@ used him from of further away .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar who was called jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and and after this is the bu@@ ri@@ an es@@ el .
and that &apos;s that the food , electrical , , transpor@@ tation and communication costs have re@@ duced by many times .
i was the one who was be@@ aten every week in the virg@@ i@@ i@@ let green and blue , until a teacher was saving my life .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , who meant the power production companies on the island , meant that we find quite great .
a p@@ ill twice a day is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the ex@@ act stati@@ now . sorry .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the country they live on .
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , one of the work@@ class g@@ working class whose population is made of im@@ migr@@ ant la@@ yers .
i loved loved to go to this business , but at a point , i wonder@@ ed for myself , you know , how come it you never buy anything ?
and i spent 30 days eating nothing like this -- walking in the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
then this community formed people who shared this big insi@@ der jo@@ , and started talking about it and playing around with it .
we have the confidence in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes we lost science in itself , and there &apos;s no reason why this shouldn &apos;t be that way .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to address the new challenges , to do what it needs .
i could also take ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the u.s. states like ter@@ mit@@ es , in that far , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arian .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by magne@@ tis@@ m my body , but through a trick , through my finger that &apos;s there right now .
so the idea is , apart from showing that br@@ ands are part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
well , he continu@@ es to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system for the fish that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
and i called her up and i ta@@ pped her knowledge to compare their exper@@ ti@@ se to what we found in the code and into the data .
in fact , this mountain of de@@ br@@ ers is acc@@ um@@ colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ men every time they drive into areas where have never fis@@ hed before .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about the and@@ sting re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
in the plans that off@@ ered almost 60 60 ds , the participa@@ tion tion is now fall@@ ing to about the six@@ th percentage .
they &apos;ll con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence that they were in an earlier form is not the way they would like to present the evidence .
now it turns out that even if you participa@@ te with finally , when more possibilities were sele@@ choices , even then , it has negative consequences .
that means that the western civili@@ za@@ -@@ history is the city has always taken taken only , but the had never given back .
of the people who sta@@ yed when it were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
if you go to this way where belief and magic is evidence and replace science , get to a place you don &apos;t want to be .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , not cheap , but it &apos;s in a frame@@ work where it &apos;s going to be much more available .
so to speed up the blind up or turn , just turn on this butt@@ on , and it makes the pul@@ se faster or slow .
and i &apos;ve probably e@@ ed by my memor@@ ies of this three-@@ week journey , i would have ad@@ e@@ ed for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting compared to what i expected .
and the biggest question that &apos;s recently asked to me is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
and i wonder what you would choose , because i often asked my friends l@@ ately , and they all wanted to go to the past .
instead than you having to code , wired wired or solve te , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to code them with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
i grew up on the country in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
but then the technology of the electro@@ ly@@ ses was developed , and made al@@ umin@@ um production so cheap that we can use it with our thro@@ wa@@ way ment@@ ality .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in the business for long long as that i can allow myself to give up piece of my own wrong pre@@ stige to allow this to happen .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel de@@ fe@@ ated . we feel thre@@ at@@ ed , maybe , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
my current activity is to design objects that with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible impossible me me to design them in a traditional sense .
so in order to that 80 percent , the industrial states need to re@@ move local countries like china , to re@@ build their electricity generation .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning by telling how much the way we ju@@ dge things depen@@ ds on what we compare it .
now of course , the question , what is actually the the most intui@@ tive trade of of humans , and now i &apos;ve already you it .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course we &apos;re ped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotion@@ ally or even both .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in the commun@@ ist east germany , you had to to , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , have to regi@@ ster it in the government .
it starts with the se@@ of , then the vac@@ ol@@ words come , then the bush bush publi@@ sh@@ ts and last , people actually do art .
we can do things now that that if they s@@ ar , if you go break , you can go into biological cy@@ cles .
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are we are responsible of the yo@@ unger brothers are responsible responsible for the destruction of the world .
why don &apos;t have the sk@@ ability of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings h@@ bs , especially if you can exp@@ and it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting when those dro@@ p@@ let learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who see that , just just say , don &apos;t lose the out of your eyes don &apos;t give up .
here was a company that was trying to solve what what become the uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for our che@@ fs and how do we keep fish on our memory cards ?
but because this individual &apos;s missing the re@@ cep@@ tors to see the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn not respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
they &apos;re a little bit technical technical and done a little more busin@@ business one out there , and they asked this yes , questions are questions .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our bor@@ ders is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
this is a network from of a network , which is actually more a kind of for@@ um where where you meet and you &apos;re discus@@ sing online .
who can guar@@ an@@ tee something that literally literally many billion times larger than any kind of tr@@ ash you can think of nuclear and other things ?
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not more pain@@ ful today , but it was pain@@ ful this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
of course , this was a bal@@ an@@ ced , al@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i just thought thought the out@@ put had to be pretty old .
and the more possibilities there is sele@@ ction , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ stics of that choice are into ded into the op@@ per@@ a costs .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted it , they acc@@ use themselves .
by not participa@@ p@@ them up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the emplo@@ yer who would have been happy to produce their contribu@@ tion .
but these oil dro@@ p@@ let were not like alive in today &apos;s sense , because every single one them them just a small , random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
le@@ gen@@ y -- like ted willi@@ ams le@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player who was met during a regular seas@@ on over 400 times .
funny funny , we still had to break down in the par@@ king lot , , so we felt we felt ghtly as a part of the spra@@ y scene .
you know , there are a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
you can uni@@ al all with re@@ mar@@ ks , send your friends , and that &apos;s a conversation about a conversation about what you feel when you feel when you look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces pieces .
and i &apos;m saying today it &apos;s more likely that we become vic@@ ti@@ ms of an online crimin@@ al than a crime in the real world .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is on c@@ amer@@ on , to ro@@ ro@@ &quot; a@@ vat@@ vat@@ ar ii under@@ water .
anthro@@ pi@@ sts have found that we always people from the members of our society always always ged one : to be useful and afford a contribu@@ tion .
so we have a situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educ@@ ated societies because they don &apos;t trust are the sources of the past .
so in a power plant , for example , if the big ste@@ am tur@@ bine turns too fast , you you have to open de@@ lo@@ it val@@ ves within milli@@ seconds .
then their bra@@ in@@ waves were measu@@ red , depen@@ ding on what you thought , or they thought thought thought , then different lights in the room .
and this is on a higher gra@@ il of user use as the the trans@@ mission of a classi@@ cal metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , just half of them are wh@@ is@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and some &apos;s still far@@ ming , hopefully wh@@ drugs and c@@ ement will be clean until that .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s called ur@@ ani@@ um .
you can actually look at it from the bottom the most important moments for olymp@@ ics for olymp@@ ics and 20@@ 12 , and and use it as a kind of connection to community .
then she said , &quot; next thing you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard doing the right thing . &quot;
so our ability to write genetic code has evolved very very slowly but still evol@@ ed , and our final point will would be put on an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
you can know how satis@@ fied someone is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t really teach a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice ver@@ sa .
in the descri@@ ption to my talk , it &apos;s written as a interpre@@ ter , me as an transl@@ ator , in english english , to understand .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter after a particular cause of death , say , acci@@ dents .
and as we also see things , what we pay attention to , and how we sort of make ourselves against our environment , so that we can think about this this accor@@ d@@ ingly .
we have to track these break@@ through@@ s with full gas , and we can measure that : in corpo@@ rate numbers , in mush@@ room projects and govern@@ ance changes .
only if you take a different example , so if you immediately makes a a ha@@ st@@ ack is bigger , it doesn &apos;t need need a reason and nothing to it .
we trust that somebody will ends time to us that have the rules are given , that we have the same goal and to to there for the playing of game .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that has a negative not@@ ation -- but you know how this is going to develop ?
and where you see , even in like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ dest bio@@ -- agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ products go back .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , developing something called the o@@ vot@@ est@@ a , is vel@@ led by ho@@ sti@@ tissue tissue o@@ vari@@ an tissue .
and i lived through this roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster because she came to the inten@@ sive care after st@@ st@@ , and hop@@ ing hop@@ ing she would re@@ cover .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new block of living provi@@ ded the laws there would build such this and not &apos;t prevent it .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher meaning , but the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated teacher are particularly meaning@@ ful .
it seems like our culture is taking a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic , &quot; well , we need to draw a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
you see , we sur@@ f on the web the first time it &apos;s really a net , not just from page to page , but much more abstra@@ ct .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut cut the price -- -- let &apos;s hit hit a new bar@@ rier and these bar@@ rier han@@ gs to co2 .
on the environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids are in their rooms , in their computers , without going out .
and if you have that pre@@ mption ure , you can understand the lo@@ gic with we we &apos;re en@@ cing happiness to be able to improve our world by a lie .
all you can see in this picture was built built a matter of of years after it took four years to get the per@@ mit@@ s .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key negative consequences for provide more and more and more choices .
my favorite one is in the middle -- mp@@ 3 play@@ gets , nose ha@@ y tri@@ mmer and cr@@ Ã¨@@ fir@@ of l@@ Ã©@@ e fac@@ kel .
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m fighting the help help of a fire@@ &apos;s main man@@ man in a volunte@@ er li@@ ver to fight the fire .
now , this is all more amazing if you can imagine that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh gh over 20 tons and shif@@ ted around 30 in@@ ches .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who &apos;s around at ted in her under@@ wear -- that means , i found a couple of things .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a good thri@@ ving bird population is not the last thing to have on a fish ? &quot;
i needed somebody who could pen@@ et@@ rate my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
in fact , if you could only reduce the price from one thing , poverty re@@ ction would be energy by far the effective effective .
we found one for them , we took them there , and we took care of them , and we gave them on her family eight because it was necessary .
but a li@@ p pen , even in this ligh@@ ting , i can tell you , is is completely in@@ efficient , but even effective , right ?
you &apos;ve seen it this year this flu , we &apos;re always a year in the back and we have dollar too little when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
this attra@@ g@@ ged our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and studied this ct .
and i just assu@@ me that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to to have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical stor@@ all over the world .
why ? this picture is quite exactly descri@@ bes why i think games are so vi@@ tal for human species in the future . seriously .
and when i close my hand , happens the the same thing by turning turning back , i &apos;m hidden through this movement that the fing@@ ers will moving back .
adap@@ tive technologies have been been been me to since learn to drive sk@@ i again , to clim@@ bing and even bi@@ ing with my hands .
all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es es changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red .
and then we looked for ti@@ ckets and data structures and tried tried to connect them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest je@@ bel , or this , as somebody vis@@ to the google side and found the front page like this .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist the los angeles times , one day through the streets at the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
and over@@ that , you also don &apos;t say your teacher , that you like to put fir@@ es somewhere and you enjoy happy when the fire is lo@@ wing after@@ wards .
the biggest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is is burning burning fossil fu@@ els .
later i later discovered that that , about the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
and of course , there are teams who have a more more ta@@ -@@ da , and under the best , fresh gradu@@ ates in child garten .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , and then about another possibility , so about an instrument to sound .
because they went around the middle man , they went around the agen@@ cies , and they said the agen@@ cies might &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
his completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s into the cru@@ t@@ ches , sending signals to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ ar computer , which is atta@@ ed here on your back .
because at this point , an individual -- learning now happened within the period of the li@@ fes@@ pan of of one single organis@@ m , rather than about this evolutionary period of time .
we pay new technologies to great attention , but for progress it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
first , how smo@@ oth she lost -- in good like bad times , war or peace , rec@@ rec@@ ession ession , depression and stimul@@ c@@ ture .
and yeah , a lot of what was told today was tou@@ ched very much , because many and many beautiful expres@@ sions were what i &apos;ve lived through .
since then in the &apos; 40 years that are now contro@@ versi@@ ted , i spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , 500 hours of it in di@@ mer@@ bo@@ bles .
because if all things are made of particles and all all these particles embra@@ follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t just follow all the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
you can see that , if we create these kind of vie@@ of view where we can pen@@ et@@ rate through images and make this experience of multiple resol@@ ution .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;ve ima@@ ged in ke@@ ke@@ ker@@ su@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and somebody brea@@ ks together , whether it &apos;s your own relationships or anyone else you can find an a@@ ed like this .
it will definitely be an energy car@@ ri@@ er , then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas to know it or sh , it will be .
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are compe@@ tive for new resi@@ dents ?
i was t@@ all in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold , domin@@ ated by a matri@@ arch@@ ch , and this matri@@ arch@@ ch was my grandmother .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that the amount of co2 that that &apos;s being em@@ it@@ per unit of energy .
what i know is it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to think about questions of democracy .
i go to the investi@@ gation prison and i go to a cli@@ ent ent who might be 13 or 14 years old , and who &apos;s supposed to be as an adult se of court .
even even though the ge@@ ar choose , doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences in inter@@ ior , it &apos;s still pre@@ p@@ are me to to choose .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l of 199@@ 9 full full of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas together .
because if you just read about it , secon@@ cular liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or saw it .
in this way , you can see that at no time is anything anything , as long as i &apos;m pres@@ sing here , nothing can go my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out .
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your own mistakes .
i &apos;m not saying , that would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the lives of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is made up of more than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided from us as an individual , in the decisions we make .
as pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble re@@ duced the different head and der kind of 26 to 15 , they experienced a increase of sal@@ es by 10 percent .
because usually we usually , through this new kind of us@@ ability , which is natural us@@ user faces , for example , are five times faster on average , on our goal .
and he said , &quot; no , only if you hear to the higher social class and have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can actually do it .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth worth worth trying to talk to some really known br@@ ands .
what &apos;s important is that a single person a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view , shared a big audience audience by acceler@@ ating the process .
we were told later that if it were to go over the regular chan@@ els , it had taken over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can create every future in@@ able , and that we can play all kinds of games .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will then this technology will apply this glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
or if we go to ti@@ bet mountains , i do a lot of the other recently , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
so if a single at@@ om at the same time can be in two different places , can be this piece of metal in two different places , why not be you ?
when i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a ill of re@@ line fla@@ vor and a glass of water .
when i found the main man , he had in a very serious conversation with the hou@@ ow@@ ner@@ ship that certainly certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
but to be fair -- the chemi@@ sts group have , over the cent@@ u@@ ries didn &apos;t get the repu@@ tation of al@@ co@@ hol man@@ ic depres@@ sed people .
we &apos;re taken light years from impro@@ impro@@ ving people , and our goal is just that that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ p@@ ts contain@@ ed a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals chemicals dan@@ ctions and there@@ by growing .
it got sil@@ t , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever fer again to the syste@@ matic of people .
i remember i have to have been eight or nine that i wo@@ ke up one morning and went to the living room , walking all my cou@@ s@@ ins .
what i want to do is a film is about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the whole film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement and marketing and ci@@ als .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in in la@@ gos morning in a plane , and i &apos;s going to to los angeles , right now it &apos;s &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
she doesn &apos;t work on on in scienti@@ fically -- she makes a c@@ up of coffee or a te@@ a , and she as@@ ks patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how are it this ?
about three or four years ago , in the middle , i got a a call from this teacher , this woman who woman who said , &quot; i have to see her .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.@@ billion years , and the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ le stone cl@@ um@@ p with lots of flo@@ flo@@ ating chemicals .
we designed a fal@@ se display with very high resol@@ ution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we ad@@ ded extra content .
so we &apos;re not a battery manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only standing between the battery battery battery and top@@ ic and everything in between .
but i was very fortun@@ ate to meet him very early , at the age of 10 of years , and so i &apos;ve been on on his clas@@ ses at my school time .
by impro@@ ving , trial and through looking at consum@@ ers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the basic elements .
and none of these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve now built over hundreds of five now in the last 20 years , none of these facili@@ ties have ever been ab@@ ot@@ ted .
if people have freedom , each of us is for ourselves to do things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our public good and no one has for us .
then wife wife car@@ r , in front of me , put put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so that &apos;s why you have to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
imagine , for example , if your wife is sad if you when you an@@ gry her , and you come with 50 ro@@ ses .
compared to the whole amount of cli@@ -@@ changing materials in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we tran@@ sc@@ end this critical point .
this is an picture of a large , new town that that built in south korea -- big than the city bo@@ st@@ ons .
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts this all is our depen@@ dence on carb@@ on-@@ based fu@@ els like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
she &apos;s one of the organi@@ z@@ ers here from this great event , and she asked me if i were to give a talk here and pri@@ cing my idea .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to reality , that there will be 1,000 dollars human genom@@ es , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available to everybody .
it also gets me get me about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m ready to motiv@@ ate me to be in interest .
after some while of refle@@ ction , it seems to me that in order to continue to write , i have to design a kind of prote@@ ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not that stupid and and they &apos;re se@@ through through the skin just to talk to us for a few minutes . &quot;
a place where women are leading the reci@@ tor , with sex &apos; hell@@ o , &quot; and the game rules the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
if we would print it it with a writing size of 10 and di@@ stances , it would inclu@@ de 14@@ 2 pages , just to print this genetic code .
so i would feel clear better with this whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
and the machines that do something like this that are pretty expensive to buy buy , commercial , the che@@ ap@@ est go off to four thousand euro@@ s .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical person , but not the normal , and you you really want to to meet this poor , gra@@ y person , if they really were ?
these might be a curi@@ per services , or techni@@ cian , for example , just to make sure that the repor@@ ted a@@ ed is still at its point .
and i realized that he ow@@ ow@@ not just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ c knowledge of music , but he conne@@ ded to her a ti@@ close personal relationship .
and when we con@@ fron@@ ed with a body that is something very different for us , it conf@@ uses in terms of categ@@ categ@@ ori@@ zation .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , the computer ha@@ cker spaces , because the c@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , nin@@ 0-@@ number thousands .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ ability of death in our bodies in occu@@ coming at the same same moment as sexual re@@ production .
we believe because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question this is , has a human human to die for one of him at@@ ro@@ cri@@ ?
if you &apos;re using the standard sele@@ ction in the decision , that means you &apos;re be over@@ wh@@ el@@ , the hot@@ test , i lose you .
and a kind of digital ligh@@ ial se at night -- but but most importantly , a new kind of experience for anyone who want to go to the top .
mar@@ ia , or , can percei@@ ve the same right in all states that h@@ ein@@ rich rich has , which is the right to mar@@ ry .
now there are some of us who are sort of forget , that that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , , i mean &quot; really different possibilities of being .
and i can say that for the reason we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully will never see again .
now , for those of us who gave up government , it &apos;s time for us to think about it about the world we want to leave our children .
and it worked . again , we created something ma@@ gical , and effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played a little more money with the film .
what they find is that the people who go from the many to the low sele@@ of pon@@ ties always and and again and choose the standard sele@@ ction .
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , you need if you need a website with h@@ tt@@ ps ps , with ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ ted services , for example , g@@ mail .
a human who opened to me do@@ ors was my pe@@ di@@ at@@ at@@ ri@@ cian at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in dolph@@ francisco .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty out of this true orig@@ it@@ , the mirror can &apos;t lie , comes out of that true orig@@ stry .
the process fe@@ e@@ ds itself itself and so , so i think i think car cat@@ aly@@ sis is the word for it -- if something incre@@ ases its speed of change .
but you know what you would be allowed to this in these a@@ part@@ ments and their environment are rule laws to avoid and avoid di@@ stra@@ ct by building it .
you can be moved with your hand , you can see each other , you can dete@@ ct your mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a recei@@ ver .
we go through the same st@@ ages which have made cell@@ cell@@ organisms -- which -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds how we hold data .
and then their pu@@ p@@ ils exp@@ and , they they came in front of their head , then they look down and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws , and they start telling their stories .
that might be to s@@ p a hy@@ dr@@ dr@@ ant to h@@ et un@@ wee@@ wee@@ ds to turn a tr@@ ash can can with a th@@ yl@@ of rat .
tri@@ ple@@ ple@@ of this letters -- these letters en@@ code about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
i think we would all understand the mo@@ od of woo@@ dy expres@@ sed to when when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach im@@ mortality through my work .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the power of artists and designers .
it &apos;s got a me@@ ga@@ watt of power , and can get six hours for six hours , and this is the battery we &apos;ve got out of simulation technology .
anyway , from the part that involved with curi@@ osity and science . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity . it was imagination .
there &apos;s a vi@@ alive self that lives in the present and knows the present is able to experi@@ la@@ ing the past , but basically only the present has .
and that &apos;s , yeah , , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing that that that you all agre@@ with is this fascin@@ ation of technology .
she took me out and and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you don &apos;t saying it on . &quot;
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ conf@@ ession , and that is , i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his his gut refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient patient a had patient b , and more .
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies , and they said no no because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
so the things that make a picture look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
and by the way , if you want to do something , of it , write up , in germany , it &apos;s best by the se@@ wa@@ ge facili@@ ties that &apos;s in frank@@ ance .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read them , and i ask you to cla@@ p you if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
i once sat in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , ale he picked up a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
but not only will we have the brand of x as a cover spon@@ sor , we &apos;re going to make sure that we will sell every possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit fear , but also the ou@@ ter concent@@ ration , very dee@@ pen@@ sed into solving a really difficult problem .
they can do in games more stron@@ ger social ties than in real life , and they get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than in the real life .
now , if i just want to get a greater over@@ view , i could be like , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with this of bi@@ ke ? &quot;
so i tried to per@@ convince the hon@@ dur@@ di@@ ans if you wanted to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
and as a con@@ sequence his gen@@ it@@ al@@ es ma@@ pped sha@@ male , his brain was the typical typical male part of the hor@@ m@@ one spectrum .
and if you as an in@@ formed citizens to make meaning@@ ful decisions in society and want to talk to them , you need to have access to knowledge and technology .
over here , we simu@@ late the whole trans@@ mission trans@@ ction system , the kilometers ter physics of the c@@ able to sort of map map the bra@@ tional behavior on the net .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , none of all .
but then he got older and he quie@@ t , and he told me that one day he on a high@@ way in los angeles , and it everything changed for him .
in the next planning elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a tur@@ um whose program promis@@ ed both new and also ten@@ ting .
so this is important because you can only look at web@@ sites in this way you can see all the internet course in the same way .
if all the fing@@ ers are in time , and just the as it moves in the notes , then sound out sound sound sound together the sound as music .
the first con@@ cre@@ te block st@@ ones were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 and came from a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le from c@@ ement with with a fix@@ ed measu@@ re@@ ments that fit together .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my hu@@ g ? &quot;
for me , the best living example of how to do is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its , i was allowed to interview it for a couple few years ago .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice in choice we to make decisions in terms of work , again and again and again , whether we should be working or not work .
he has x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his side b@@ b@@ ys were so so active that they had basically created a male hor@@ one environment .
so it starts , this old sti@@ b inside him gets up , like as i &apos;m going lose this thing , and i &apos;ll being tra@@ cked by this song forever .
at the time , when the great indian war@@ prin@@ ce ar@@ jun@@ a had thir@@ st , he took an ar@@ c , he ot@@ ed into the floor and water .
and that is , the software ha@@ cker , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s 0s ei@@ gh@@ gh@@ 0s years , they started with computer tin@@ ker@@ ing , and it &apos;s also created ged the internet .
think it in mar@@ mar@@ the commun@@ ist in sa@@ ig@@ on , how he must ad@@ mit that his life had been a single waste .
op@@ per@@ tun@@ ality costs dro@@ ps the happiness that we get through our sele@@ ction , even if what we cho@@ sen is fantastic .
what if you could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or re@@ re@@ duc@@ ing of risk or stro@@ kes ?
it was in the middle of the night , and she in in bat@@ eping le@@ ies , and bar@@ e@@ foot bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen in the the rain , while her house was standing in fl@@ ames .
and in a couple of hours , he ends up , and r@@ ents a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these amazing ted dinner ton@@ ight .
this is of indi@@ cate that inside the bu@@ b has already known that he was actually related to the fire , but he he can &apos;t say that out l@@ oud .
and this is bio@@ curious , which also mentioned mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this yes , sort of vol@@ k@@ ot school , essentially for molecular biology .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes , re@@ re@@ cting genes , that n@@ .@@ a , frag@@ ments for you to make them visible .
and starting from these networks that did the whole popular popular , it &apos;s evolved such a scene that i want to portra@@ te brie@@ fly .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal inter@@ rup@@ tions of the un@@ inten@@ ded , od@@ od@@ d push to out@@ it .
and that &apos;s what what happens that we have the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and that shif@@ shif@@ the own production of our individual memor@@ ies to to ex@@ ternal media .
after first of looking &apos;ve cho@@ sen a piece to play , because you &apos;re excited about this , you &apos;re just resear@@ research the emergen@@ ting of the com@@ position .
we don &apos;t believe in a pool of docum@@ ents of a government who gives us data , and i understand this , i think we all do .
and we hope , of course , that we can stop spread a similar way , and we &apos;re also a similar connected , so that content can be be involved in more people on it .
i combin@@ ed it with my earlier pre@@ pre@@ fer@@ bs for drawing , but it was a little different , because in the use of the camera was the process , which , more , in planning .
no , i actually had of mi@@ mi@@ from this fish because , , i swe@@ ar to god , who had s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed for this conversation to to chicken .
they had gone over 75 kinds of o@@ live oil , including those who were lo@@ ded in bo@@ xes that came out from a thousand years old o@@ live trees .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es here , it &apos;s about preser@@ ving people alive , and it &apos;s going be a highest time to understand what that means .
and these fortun@@ e to virtu@@ alize the virtual the reality , they also had needed to have bit@@ ter in the pre-@@ industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
so it &apos;s not enough to just read gra@@ des and press press the appropriate keys on the piano , or the right the right place on a vi@@ o@@ lin ite .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i car@@ ried all this week .
it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curi@@ osity and put enough energy in , you can get there .
and you could have conne@@ cting them to government services if it were been needed , but a neighb@@ or is much better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund ds sel@@ ting , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to push it tomorrow tomorrow .
play en@@ han@@ ces creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about gener@@ creation of diversity -- variety of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity &apos;s variety of connections .
he says we shouldn &apos;t ju@@ dge people after &quot; their skin color , but after the characteri@@ stic of their character , and and goes out beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
so as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that fit better to how our brains and bodies work .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself why do all the the shape start with so natural , arch@@ a@@ ic jud@@ forms of communication , interaction and so on and so on .
now , when we tele@@ phone phone a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting out@@ come that came out of this gall@@ up po@@ ll .
that &apos;s kind of very sad for ha@@ cker scene , because it &apos;s not true what she actually started and what &apos;s actually behind it .
my mother &apos;s pr@@ g@@ at@@ ric diagno@@ stics of my mother was on vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually catch in , but i want to always make it look like if you could have that , in a photo .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundament@@ alize the function of government in a way that can actually do something by en@@ han@@ ing society .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investi@@ gation ations that show that people like more after playing with them , even even if they &apos;ve de@@ fe@@ ated evil .
this is not like human@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chemi@@ cally distin@@ ction from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ tic .
okay , let &apos;s re@@ think that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that meas@@ ures success at the health of your predat@@ ors .
the same technology that can ces human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t just serve protection from protection from themselves , but also can serve for imm@@ unity against other viruses .
and he went back for the first time , in both of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the par@@ king lot .
in the other , i was wra@@ pped in un@@ safe life , the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , of the drug ab@@ use and isol@@ lation .
you have a curious language and a marriage pro@@ ic@@ al called the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y , you &apos;ve got to mar@@ ry somebody who spea@@ a different language .
when we war@@ med it up , turned the light and looked at the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
that means , in the local village has actually become a global village with the same principles , of course , possible intui@@ tive , but but also total transpar@@ ency .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers showed back this this idea and replace it through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people were created equ@@ ally .
i know and i &apos;m sure sure you do the job because they &apos;re come out of a number of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house and play very oud music , and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock sh@@ mp ? &quot;
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar , called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes he &apos;s say , wol@@ f sing@@ er says , there &apos;s no freedom of will .
some re@@ f@@ use give up and and and bra@@ ckets to the bit@@ ter , while others are not stopped it and cr@@ as@@ hing in in a case of dra@@ matic passion .
so if we look at the evolution of our society , here in a second , we &apos;re now now moving from the third to the fourth social generation of society .
unlike the ol@@ d-@@ class middle class sub@@ ur@@ bs where existence was completely un@@ known to me , there was no dem@@ ging thinking in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
and g@@ ary said that he was willing to offer all the in this audience a single including vac@@ ation to the most most beautiful street in the world .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a , which has been built in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
of course , the problem is that , and we start to look at all the common@@ ari@@ ties , we need to start to question why we susta@@ tain certain separ@@ ctions .
so , really got my interest , and we started working with , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and then on a clou@@ dy day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun broke out , and i said maybe i can feel better again .
we have a com@@ ic about it . we have the level high for local , knowledge knowledge , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly be very experience of your child &apos;s foot@@ ball game have been very different than it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ ell me and they say , &quot; what does it care ? let people do what they want .
today , you can complete sequence sequence of three billion base irs of the human genome a price of about $ $ ,000 and in in the room of about a week .
in a world where every minute two two days of video is plo@@ aded u@@ plo@@ aded , only it can really unique and un@@ expected videos like the videos i mentioned about .
because , as the the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it of it , and no opportunity to form really well .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a a race , they took your budget and your money on a good driver and a good car .
i came to the reali@@ zation as a doctor that i was working with a target that was different from the goal of evolution -- inevi@@ t@@ ably con@@ tradi@@ stent , only different .
just consider that a mas@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or with phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile mobile communication than president re@@ ag@@ an 25 years ago .
he was s@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into prison at age age two to hi@@ de under her rock@@ zi@@ ap@@ mit because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ on-@@ of atoms made up of the piece of metal are sil@@ t , and at the same time , same atoms are going up and down .
and it will allow people measure their blood pressure from home to send him to their doctor and share him with others for a more than 100 dollars .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , for example , this plant here .
they were just told that be the one-@@ graduate students , and they &apos;re the students with the grade , and they &apos;re also them , they they taught something and they treated them .
and as you can see , this is a very ini@@ tial area , and you had to somehow of navi@@ gate , from from island to island to raise food .
and she works in a medical culture , which recogni@@ zes that people fill the the system with life , and if that &apos;s then also make mistakes from time to time .
place of terror@@ ist muscle , but this was called the fu@@ tr@@ on@@ ics , and made wind and solar energy , and i started started in the mi@@ of the 8@@ 0s .
it was pro@@ ven to me over and over again , when this week , people to me in this , , just because of what i was what i was wearing , and i had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
depen@@ ding on c@@ i , and when i know , of course course , a very different narra@@ verage than if there is a kind of living of itself .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal tains in quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to throw throw all the pas@@ travel@@ ers out .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ es a a self from a survi@@ vor self , time has very little influence in this story .
and you don &apos;t have to -- the attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to put the pay@@ data over a us@@ b stick as we saw at stu@@ x@@ net .
the basic idea of this company was to ski@@ p the phase analog@@ y processes with visual prin@@ inter@@ s , etc . , to start with digital produ@@ ctions .
and because we &apos;re nothing more important than our survive , the first stop for all of the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
now i don &apos;t want you to imagine too much time time to imagine gener@@ us , because if you &apos;re imagine the stuff all the time you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects that i got the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , the ones where i directly inter@@ ded directly with things .
you have to deal two things : : one medical medical being am@@ pu@@ pu@@ t@@ and and the social opini@@ about whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
so , to buy new je@@ ans after after many years of the wearing in the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in course , to make sense that conversation , of course , i to know something about this remarkable faith in the dou@@ n , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is is not a cul@@ t of the black magic .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite full p@@ ure if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence of you came from you .
we di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed virtu@@ ally 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , did the shift from the anal@@ o@@ g world biology to the digital world of computers .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the the highest , not to be there , right ?
and this is not bad for a project where almost every ad agen@@ cy that we talked to re@@ com@@ men@@ ded their cli@@ ers to let the fing@@ ers of it .
i spend most of my time working with the social we@@ we@@ ak@@ est in social building sett@@ ments and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
a country has already off@@ ered to provide its su@@ me court as a court for the the good al of the the court system there .
and i was ama@@ zed to bu@@ mp resi@@ stance , resi@@ stance to what is up the end the most effective in in the health care in human history .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust when you see in it@@ al@@ y how people ki@@ pped out in the high bo@@ w of co@@ do@@ can out of the car , out of the car .
and then my friends say , make small indepen@@ dent@@ al films , &quot; well , how do we compe@@ te with these big giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
they ni@@ vel@@ v@@ ed the game , and they decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , that count the common@@ ali@@ ties , , not the differences , and that was very radical .
and at the end , we really really a ele@@ ction . we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ia or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ ger spac@@ ec@@ raft in 199@@ 0 , when it passed by saturn , back to earth ?
what she pro@@ ved back was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they re@@ placed it through another that was another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years was central to us .
i sent out some facebook mes@@ , some twitter twitter news , and i gave people the people the chance to stand on rights at my ted@@ talk 2011 .
because we did all of this with just 10 to 12 people who worked been years years of of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted , and sometimes we were two to three months of a row row on la@@ ke .
i &apos;m saying that i close my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars or comes out in my sle@@ e@@ ve , and that &apos;s a lie .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , especially if you want to make people happy , this coura@@ ge to lie .
and maybe we can get to vi@@ oles@@ ence as something natural , co@@ her@@ ent and useful and feel no feel har@@ b@@ sed like this through their pres@@ ence .
but they also true a secret to our future , a future where we need to ada@@ pt to to increasing challenges , through larger creativity and prin@@ ter rein@@ forced co@@ operation .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything you for you , everybody knew you this em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us that helped you .
and a lot of discus@@ sions i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar like the discussion that i &apos;ve had had in the last 30 years , to photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
the reason i felt worse was because , with all these acc@@ essi@@ available , , my expec@@ tations for what makes a good good couple je@@ ans went up .
a string lo@@ ar@@ der , if you make it of water , you has enough pressure , so i think so 40 to six bar on it .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh moments than others , and under the worst ones are fresh b@@ w@@ l gradu@@ ates .
after all , this older black man , with a very concerned fac@@ ial faces , came to the cour@@ thou@@ room and sat down behind me , almost to the defen@@ se bank .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , to met me , she trans@@ formed turned into a box of as@@ as@@ hes and was la@@ id into my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might typically require maybe 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it to a thousand years -- and maybe over the next 100 years .
his job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted than less than a billi@@ billion in a second after the beginning of the universe -- and that up to 600 million times in a second .
it says , &quot; this airplane is made of hundreds of thousands of little bits that work together to make your flight sa@@ fer . &apos; doesn &apos;t make you more obvious ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; th@@ yl@@ rat in my land@@ ash ton . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
that means , &apos;re pro@@ j@@ ci@@ te our first see , before we then see it bring that back the back in our se@@ red appar@@ at@@ us to say , okay .
on nine people we ex@@ ecu@@ ted ted is one that we &apos;ve found for inno@@ cent and was dis@@ lo@@ aded and rele@@ ged of the death row .
i personally fin@@ the . it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to have a com@@ promise with the ideas with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to face people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use these inter@@ active media and in order that they can create a satis@@ fying experience .
when i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s ; i &apos;m all about creating a life of possibilities .
so an organis@@ m could for learn to learn to eat a certain fru@@ it because she liked poor@@ ly and it sick the last time he ate it .
i mean , it can sound strange d to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i was 17 out at the time when when i took once again in one of his clas@@ ses and was going and played the last one of the four bal@@ uses of ch@@ op@@ in , a later work .
but the lat@@ re@@ lights got back quite back , and people in my company told me that we were pre@@ pre@@ li@@ min@@ , not yet able to do that .
and sometimes , a small prototyp@@ e of this experience is everything it takes to get us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ &quot; -- to bring to a ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
so i decided to visit the bran@@ e@@ it one day , and i asked the la@@ der , &quot; does this model work that they really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
we need to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we need to think about , but as we get into the time machine and go into the future we &apos;re going to be gla@@ d have done that .
the director of con@@ gress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank thank you very much for your talk , but we might look at ted@@ talk .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are doctors , but 25 percent of the pa@@ bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of health staf@@ f .
we want to encoura@@ the the world of , the inv@@ ent@@ or who encoura@@ ge them , because this world that which we live in , this inter@@ active world bel@@ on@@ gs us .
and then we &apos;ve that it &apos;s not com@@ connection , but that &apos;s that is , i think , has been relatively well to it , and people are quite convinced like this .
so there i stood back with a small team on an un@@ known ter@@ rain , we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ work , nu@@ par@@ ties and ni@@ ghts , tony dre@@ w for the first time after seven years .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we expect the first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue our to out what the building blocks of the universe is .
how you can increase happiness very differently depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think about the memory ber@@ self , or whether you think about the survi@@ vor@@ itself .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear you like this . &quot;
but lat@@ est dna evidence show that the the tr@@ tr@@ us@@ who who later showed the ro@@ man king@@ pi@@ re the same dna as the old ly@@ di@@ ans .
well , there &apos;s br@@ ands and and ei@@ ght-@@ ful br@@ ands , these things that are coming and going , but a play@@ ful , ght-@@ ful brand is a pretty strong thing .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- that dig them you without all the comple@@ xi@@ ties .
in a country that has just a major crisis behind con@@ con@@ con@@ gress was ele@@ cted with 1@@ 24 to a voice .
when i was a gradu@@ ation student at stanford university , i went to this very ex@@ clu@@ sive gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at the time it was really ex@@ clu@@ sive .
but the de@@ ception of lo@@ gic allows us to pre@@ tend if the first sentence of ce@@ is wrong as if you would have to take the opposite without evidence .
it &apos;s a very happy conc@@ ert again and again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve worked as long in ad@@ v@@ ance as re@@ experience .
but these app@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies , that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government who pay ta@@ xes and recei@@ ve performance .
it seems like we &apos;re quite dis@@ cted from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the most part , the basic mechanis@@ ms our cells are quite the same .
and i would be happy to say to you that my worst mistakes ror only in the first five years what a lot of my colleagues argue , but total non@@ sense sense .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and that would come back and wei@@ off all the images images on the walls would be gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tis .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , the coal coal plants plants , because we don &apos;t otherwise or stur@@ , because it &apos;s not going .
according to bur@@ g was the pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls about this film .
but this kee@@ ps me a@@ wake at night -- one of the things that keep a@@ wake at night and we never needed as b@@ ad@@ ately scientific progress as now , never never .
in actually , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code to a new phase of biology by making new life and building new life .
so what was a problem that these re@@ ac@@ tors is problem , what we fill in our fill , and so that can dra@@ dra@@ redu@@ reduce the waste volu@@ me during this process .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dan@@ gers , other only create when they just the fire .
so we take something very complicated , we we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we create something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it turns out that if you make something feel feel con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for ving the people we love from f@@ te wal@@ ks , but also also pre@@ p@@ are them to get good with it .
how about the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever you are a voice to to pay attention and creating change for the the first time ?
i told my wife , whenever whenever a human in a moral justi@@ gation , the the because , we should try to replace it by replace it by the liter@@ ke .
i love the , on any opportunity to find another color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , to wear , and also photograph@@ ing over the the time time the ging .
now , in eg@@ y@@ pt were lo@@ ot@@ ed the in@@ sur@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in apri@@ l 2011 the head@@ quar@@ ters of eg@@ yp@@ yp@@ ti@@ an police police quar@@ ters , and they found a lot of recor@@ ds .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world about about something without having to say a word .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies , products and services that , within a decade of positive the lives of billion people &apos;s lives .
they didn &apos;t count it because he was rema@@ ined with a memory , the remin@@ der was was ru@@ ined , and the memory was everything he had gotten to keep .
i think that molecular biology in general now , so in general speaking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything that you count , syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
i came to the ted because i think many lot of have have understood that the moral pen@@ dul@@ um of the universe far way , but that it incre@@ ases justice .
a process that acts -- like anyone knows who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , actually everyone here -- kee@@ ps not always reas@@ on@@ able .
and something interesting thing about this , because which was fascin@@ fascin@@ ated me by jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ aus shows , what was was was the idea of a completely had a completely un@@ known world on our earth itself .
and our european verb@@ al network is basically just a of lou@@ of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of big power plants , where the wave is is around ing all over europe .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i would take several months of months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
so these are just a few of the cli@@ ps i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- but it could have been been for the last six days , or the last six years .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have about , the stron@@ gest psycho@@ ac@@ pre@@ prepar@@ ate from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the am@@ man .
already , from the ger@@ man@@ s to english can require more knowledge , even you if you &apos;s about den@@ temp@@ ness or even about poetry .
i can make the sound es that the b@@ ach has had on the modern wings of what a aro@@ aro@@ c@@ em@@ bal@@ o cannot cannot .
but also appropriate appropriate , because it turns out that by using this all of time , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re able to do as human beings .
and i was to myself that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction , and never given a mistake that the voice could bl@@ around .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything was worse than anything was was , it was able to be possible for people who were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email where i said that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me in &apos; education .
we all had to do that at the time . if we read as children , we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ or and we put it on the can@@ v@@ as in our heads .
and if you &apos;ve already earlier that the dro@@ one of stu@@ x@@ net complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you the user data is a science itself .
and very lot times i &apos;ve worked with inter@@ sexual people whose their gender is at@@ yp@@ ical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or the female body types .
how it would feel like living in a world where the ger@@ man state made people do especially if a lot of of ws there were a lot of je@@ them .
are they reli@@ able , stable , family , safe , bo@@ ty , sac@@ red , thought like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
i spoke out l@@ oud , sen@@ o , you thing , you and i both know both if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fau@@ lt , right ?
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we might be a new form of the cam@@ brian explosion in where there might be massive new new species education based on this digital design .
and we &apos;re bo@@ ourselves looking at the media cam@@ pus , like , virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ lab , we can actually do this all the time .
and because the government ultimately takes takes its force from us -- remember &quot; we do the people ? &quot; -- how we think , will affect how this change happens .
so it &apos;s that far . . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the l@@ h@@ c , is the largest scientific experiment that has ever commit@@ ed -- 27 kilometers in the diam@@ e@@ ter .
because it makes as much sense as anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it came to expla@@ ining the absolutely in@@ san@@ su@@ ing mo@@ ver@@ ac@@ ty of the creative process .
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s written in a couple of days and then spre@@ ads from rare , is a kind of shot shot before the bo@@ g at the government &apos;s institution .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone , you &apos;d tell you , oh , his dad &apos;s a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me an belie@@ dent in our future is the fact that we have more more today more power than individuals to give us the big challenges of our planet .
at this point , and if you lau@@ gh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to know something what artists can share with us very well .
they st@@ are out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ ded chan@@ n@@ els and that den@@ sity , ab@@ und@@ y mar@@ ch .
let &apos;s move back to my world of medicine world where where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less well-@@ being i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
we now have , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies from around the world , dat@@ ab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that are design design components of the future .
and what happens is that when you think about the life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , say , in climate .
but then another step , very interesting step , where things became completely different , which is these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities of cells emer@@ ged .
one of the areas where we see this is bei@@ bei@@ iel , in our culture culture today , in the today &apos;s united states , the strug@@ tles about the beginning and the end of life .
basically , you get every round on every offen@@ er at happen to be shown letters , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re te@@ sted about a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that lets us explore us and interact , and , and the un@@ expected lin@@ that that we form is the real nutri@@ ground of creativity .
well , i was a few people in the company , and no one could give me a de@@ cent answer until i finally tele@@ phone with sen@@ ior bi@@ ologists .
in the last 100 years , the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled that adap@@ ted to inf@@ lation the average income of the world &apos;s has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
when i tell you that somebody or@@ dered their life as eight on a scale of 10 , they had a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with their survi@@ vor vation .
my wife , my kids and i moved to the garage , and that ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy theor@@ ist and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house .
unlike the entertain@@ ment of the 20th century the 20th , participa@@ tion of the community is to way to part part of this phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or making something new out of it .
we can take one step further out and re@@ ar@@ the data back and see that cir@@ atory disease and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of the big fish we love , the tun@@ a , the hei@@ l@@ bu@@ tte , the sal@@ mon , s@@ wor@@ fish , they have collap@@ sed .
i got a traffic ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ cket because i haven &apos;t ri@@ te on the bi@@ ke , , but often are are dis@@ abilities that don &apos;t let you drive you all the way on the bi@@ ke .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so that , and so i would be able to care for my patients without cont@@ ac@@ ting it .
and if we get to of course , it gets us for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for henry and mau@@ ri@@ tz and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
if we look at one of the fo@@ fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he he off@@ ers us in his , &quot; i have a dream talk , &quot; a kind of solution .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came to our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us us animals and places and a world of wonder@@ wonder that we could never have ined before .
in every step we &apos;ve produced these pieces in over@@ shot so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ process process which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along , most with the other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good share lo@@ gic to fit the complex ideas together .
and because there was no video games or this over@@ sat@@ u@@ ration with computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated movies or the whole ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the research -- say , , u.s. should spend 10 billion a year a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
and imagine , i actually negoti@@ ated as a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . , and so trying to stop these practic@@ es , natural without e@@ ed .
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ able , electricity gener@@ ating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then spend 20 years .
but it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs , and get them to play some kind of play together to control their health better .
as you knew in the village back who , who &apos;s happening with whom and when , this today about this exten@@ sion of ourselves through these mobile end@@ devices at a global scale .
now , what i hear all hearing is : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ ci@@ , , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
a lot of journ@@ alists called me about the question , &quot; what test are you going to tell us if ca@@ ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male male ? &quot;
and intui@@ intui@@ tive user ability not first since apple is a fundamental economic factor of basic success factor if if i to make make technology devices to human beings .
that means , the interpre@@ has to trans@@ late this un@@ stri@@ act attack of emergen@@ cy language into another , which is to trans@@ late hearing , con@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al music language .
and so we decided to build a hall to build in ber@@ lin , where we can sort of map the electrical propor@@ of the island the scale of one to three in the pre@@ cis@@ ely .
the film studio , i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship , and it was a love movie of epi@@ c cu@@ sto@@ m , a passionate movie .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using zer@@ emissions emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
so discus@@ sions , they &apos;ve been tried , these insu@@ lan@@ , they &apos;re going to au@@ tar@@ k , they have a little network , and which has nothing to do with our connection and nothing .
so they invented , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the cu@@ game and com@@ bine a national strategy , and on one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
i &apos;m a ma@@ le animal . in order to work , i have to get up day at the same time and swe@@ at , ti@@ pped me and tor@@ ture through aw@@ k@@ ward .
so you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classi@@ cal so@@ mer@@ com@@ ty , you need five hours hours and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
if you also play , you &apos;ll see some nu@@ an@@ ces here , which went up and the mou@@ mouth are a sign of optimis@@ m , the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws show surprise .

and yet , burning coal coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remark@@ ably clean coal technology see here , everything changes .
that , instead than re@@ ber@@ ing us ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , wid@@ ely common in wi@@ common patterns of memor@@ ies that we can hang our personal memor@@ ies .
of course , the chance in rand@@ dent@@ ly ly of sen in@@ struc@@ tions is that , by accident they sort numbers , so none of the in@@ struc@@ tions are tions will actually do this .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of rene@@ w@@ ables , so energy per year , not the achie@@ vement right now , you have to turn off the dies@@ el .
you should talk about this strategy of innovation , and you would be sho@@ cked the ridi@@ cul@@ ous w@@ ds ds spent on this innovative approach@@ es .

and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the s@@ hal@@ oceans oceans is as rich in intri@@ gu@@ ing life as we can really &apos;t &apos;t imagine .
then the volu@@ me of se@@ man@@ tic cross connection and the ab@@ und@@ ance that out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c web effect .
if people were to take this seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on its head , everything we believe , for example , in ta@@ x policy and so on .
but in the mid@@ &apos; 9@@ 0s , we realized that in the cre@@ at@@ re@@ - and forces ter design -- what we had actually started the company company -- came slowly to forward .
and i &apos;m going to have more life life experience than today , and therefore going to go to my pal@@ pal@@ ette of sounds sounds have have a much more color an@@ ces , in emotions and emotion than it is today .
they &apos;re also dealing in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct of biological materials and , yes , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics pa@@ ker@@ les , , , and com@@ bine it in a of des@@ quickly wn way .
now , that &apos;s good , bes@@ i@@ des paul wal@@ walking around and about about vac@@ cin@@ es , saying , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jam@@ ming .
it looks something like who has no freedom of will@@ , can can &apos;t be dra@@ for for actions actions and cla@@ ims to be table , and so it &apos;s un@@ calcul@@ table .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we look at whether we can use ed co2 , which could simply be brought to production reli@@ bs , conver@@ t the co2 into the fuel to drive this process .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed the speed of this actor , you &apos;re actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually eventually explo@@ de the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
we should call them what it is , a industry in paper , , a industry that stri@@ that quickly e@@ col@@ o@@ o@@ capital , that allows just this production .
it &apos;s the survi@@ vor self that the doctor pri@@ ses -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; &quot; is it hurt if i touch you here ? &quot;
now , if we go on and age , , say , 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see that even acci@@ dents is even the main cause about which people should worry about .
my first memor@@ ies are of this boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ ly ck@@ ers of of the engine , cla@@ pping pping any wave on the bu@@ g , the expan@@ an and empty hori@@ zon .
and these scientists just docum@@ ented the different top@@ ics that these ce@@ o has dealing , and how much time they spent decisions decisions related with the issues .
everybody thinks i &apos;d walked away between the ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; and would have cele@@ br@@ ated on a na@@ ils on a hand@@ to@@ we@@ l on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do it as well , because that love story , as roman@@ roman@@ tically always , is also in@@ umin@@ ative .
it was ex@@ pri@@ ed in the cell , and it zed the other chromo@@ some some as a foreign material , and so we end only had one cell with a new chromo@@ some .
and by the way , we hi@@ and circu@@ late late and mix us so mix so much that they can no longer say that isol@@ ation is necessary evolution evolution evolution to go on .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real , and that games have a huge meaning of change .
so if you take the system the way i was taught , and all the mis@@ er@@ ved health exper@@ , , no one one left at the end .
the second tra@@ p is a vari@@ ation of experience and memory : basically , it is happy between its life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
so gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sexual als are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread across the band@@ wid@@ th .
you go up into this cap@@ su@@ le , then you flo@@ ating down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment environment , where there &apos;s no hope is for res@@ cu@@ e , if you don &apos;t make it back .
i think the remarkable remarkable of the process last few years , the last few decades is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
so you also realize that there &apos;s a change in there , and only from that defen@@ ur@@ vation to yes to the idea , hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able is true .
and in my view , the scientific way of trying things out is to see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achie@@ v@@ ements of humanity .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , at a point when there was a break , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , we be able to look at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
and because they &apos;re working much more harder than physi@@ cally , and because they live only three to six months , they cor@@ in their weight , a a 30 billion billion people in the energy consumption .
if this device sequen@@ ces a r@@ p or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls calls the the agen@@ cy and it v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic from your out@@ break .
a lot of argu@@ ments about it . fish her@@ ts cont@@ amin@@ ate the environment , most of them , anyway , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , let &apos;s tun@@ a tun@@ a &apos;s a big dis@@ advantage .
now , if you calcu@@ late it , people bought six times more bought a glass of mar@@ in@@ ade who you had six to sele@@ ec@@ than if they ele@@ were 24 .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ i@@ ist her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might be this this , the story about how and why games have been invented .
but i think in this frame here and and inten@@ tion of making something real out of de@@ ception , i &apos;m just going to leave leave the need@@ le in there and go from the stage .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the bo@@ re@@ dro@@ walk in ven@@ ice , my kids were brought in in also , my dog , and we created this one .
now , per@@ all these rand@@ om@@ cho@@ sen in@@ struc@@ tions , run out all the programs , and eventually the ones that i are clo@@ s@@ est to my do . &quot;
so so i sent them home , i ab@@ meas@@ ded a quie@@ t voice in me , who was trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
these are two very different un@@ its that en@@ vor@@ ve themselves and the memory itself , and conf@@ t@@ ing the two is part part of the the no@@ tual of happiness .
and after a very short period of it had lost all the characteri@@ stics of species , and it completely conver@@ ted completely into a new species based on the new software we &apos;ve given in the cell .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think you think , a director has to be to to , a leader must be like a ship cap@@ tains or something .
and as far as isol@@ ation is , if we col@@ oni@@ ze planets as a dist@@ of the species , there will be isol@@ lation and the changes of the environment could produce evolution in a natural way .
we predi@@ cted that in 10 years , the rate of recogni@@ tion ci@@ vi@@ c hon@@ rights will be as high as they passed ele@@ ction law .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up with the internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things things together , and you just have to build the right systems .
we &apos;ve have phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years , and and now , now by the phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing is been brought much ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than it are used in all nuclear facili@@ ties .
that our system also has a price increase is because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with dies@@ el and we don &apos;t go through an impro@@ ases on the other things .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the con@@ temp@@ t you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve been wh@@ el@@ med a task that you can &apos;t explain any another thing .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at at least for those of us who have ed to these dist@@ ant tar@@ on earth to realize that they &apos;re not re@@ moved at all .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing was to present your product as many people as possible , as many people as possible .
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , have 17 ie@@ ants of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca that you all all recognize at great distance in in the forest that that appear to our eyes as a way .
we see many , many gi@@ gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes digital digital here here that you can se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ going , switch , can re@@ range in any way .
and my love of science fi@@ ction seemed to refle@@ ct itself in my environment , because back , in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon and explor@@ ed the deep sea .
this is a people who are &apos;t cogni@@ tively different between color between blue and green , because the sky sti@@ scene es the forest that dep@@ end on are equal on .
what do you think like the average performance of a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , should be a mid@@ ker , a res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant ?
suppose you have a blind blind , , and you trans@@ mit@@ ted to an oper@@ ator whose average performance is 400 in blind blind blin@@ lights .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful cho@@ irs of &quot; close eye , &quot; and here and the change , &quot; asi@@ an , goes home . &quot;
now , i went enough years come out of my comfort to know that , yes , , the world brea@@ ks apart , but not the as you fear it .
there was just out that there were self-@@ ste@@ ed businesses , and one of of them was sitting in cr@@ ss@@ berg berg where where you was the evil .
last month , i &apos;ve had the pleasure of announ@@ it the qu@@ al@@ comm@@ foundation called the $ $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really makes a something positive , as op@@ posed to and mo@@ i@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
for the memory itself , a two-@@ week ation ation is not much much better than the week vac@@ ation , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
my call to everybody who fly today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- not -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
and the women came with their stories about men who did not take the change , an@@ gry and un@@ flexi@@ ble , and gener@@ ated children , tra@@ pped between two worl@@ ds .
this has never been before in the history of technology development , , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth by which the order exponenti@@ ally incre@@ ases every every few years .
i bu@@ g@@ ged my father until finally finally , a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
so in fact , the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t work as well as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t work as well as the need@@ le .
there could be quite kind , wonderful , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , expres@@ ter thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species , we con@@ figu@@ ned us our environment that we &apos;ve managed it make they ada@@ pt to us and and we ada@@ pt to them .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the science fi@@ ction range was : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; ali@@ ens , and &quot; ab@@ ss ss &quot;
well , very brie@@ fly , another reason we can &apos;t clearly think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and if we actually live .
and i went back through the same tor@@ ture of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , felt liber@@ ated me , and went tra@@ tra@@ k to work it happened again and again and again .
we &apos;re hard hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s we &apos;re not willing to approach us approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m is the desire to immediately do something something , to master a hur@@ d@@ le , together together with the belief that we have a fo@@ unded hope for success .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably to go home four hours more hours , but your emplo@@ yer or anybody else already think of which you &apos;re promis@@ es them with the four hours .
it turns out that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and wei@@ k@@ te of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
they were the notion that people who had political power , people should have this political power because of the her@@ her@@ blood line from the grand@@ father &apos;s father father for son and so on .
she came from a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pa@@ thetic , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , playing on a vi@@ o@@ lin who only had two str@@ ings .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as an architec@@ ts , engineers , a designer , we always think about how the people who use things that we design .
i &apos;ve let some people count the number of books that were published happiness happiness in the last five years , and they gave up up about 40 , and there was a lot more more .
arm@@ strong twitter tter@@ ed over us and then , in dec@@ ember , hon@@ or@@ ed us to the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine as one of the the 50 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really ne@@ .
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ v@@ ine di@@ dy spirit that comes from a re@@ mot@@ dist@@ far , un@@ known source to people -- for un@@ expla@@ able , un@@ known reasons .
and then i got at it in the mi@@ d-@@ &apos; 8@@ 0s to ber@@ lin , because i wanted to do rene@@ w@@ able energy , and that wasn &apos;t there it was in car@@ ce@@ al@@ m .
it &apos;s not just code for america , and there are hundreds of people all over the country standing up and government app@@ s every day in their own communities .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , in a case , sper@@ m has a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ .
not just from darwin &apos;s work work we we know that human ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ed by the struggle of the human mind to turn through conflict .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a little unit of plastic telling us from a world of sta@@ tic st@@ st@@ blocks to a world where everything would be inter@@ inter@@ active .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption medi@@ ation for people like you and me , which , if they think about it doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects are in the el@@ ev@@ ator are actually only objects that are put together in a small space .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t been free , and it was my job to learn that the story tried to cr@@ ush ush ourselves , but were through it .
but it takes them to get reach pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow her brea@@ sts grow and evol@@ ve , but it doesn &apos;t get it period period until somebody comes comes to there &apos;s something different here .
now , in our city , in volunte@@ ers suppor@@ ted a high-@@ quali@@ ill professional figh@@ se , you have to be pretty early at the brand place to mix@@ mix .
and the deep@@ est part of all , we we ever be able to develop the wisdom and ma@@ the the wisdom we will need to make these decisions ?
and we think we want to think this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe only most of the electr@@ onic health projects are missing : because we stopped listening .
now , with all our digital devices that make us seven days a week , putting all 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not mira@@ cle we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
and they do some tests , and they find out that instead of sti@@ inning eg@@ eg@@ ings and u@@ ter@@ us , she actually f@@ in in , and that she has a y chromo@@ some .
no longer a building that would open to let them , but a building that still had ks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting we@@ t .
but tomorrow , to give us the challenges -- think , think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- then how we then move from the digital world to physical .
the fellow dri@@ vers in@@ moving objects are not just humans , but the light that appe@@ ars to them and the wind that that ben@@ ds past them and the heat of the space .
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i , whether you believe it or not , from those ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ers to wear nothing new .
and we start by taking the tr@@ arb@@ age that already exists in these re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or dry contain@@ ers of of the ac@@ ac@@ tors and that &apos;s our start fuel .
it dem@@ ands that we all do our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking opti@@ m@@ mal , like our feelings and our do , the challenge ahead of us .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re reali@@ zing all kinds of things -- -- as you fly directly through walls , or that you can can be in two different places at the same time .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some of others , which we often arri@@ ve in our field , are sort of just in a se@@ mi@@ i log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3@@ .@@ 5 foot tru@@ ck that ck has to be under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can basically squ@@ ee@@ ze that below it .
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars usually serve for a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing for my very personal qu@@ est .
most of them are digital digital photos of a camera , but this one is , for example , a scan of the library of con@@ gress gress , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ x@@ els .
all you have to do is you look at the bit@@ ter dea@@ ths of really great minds alone from the 20th century alone , young , and often died of own hand .
in fact , that you obje@@ obje@@ tively , the first had more information than the second time the second time , but i d@@ are to guess that you felt it was was the second real .
so when i knew that i was going to come here in a ted@@ talk at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
now , of all the people i met was the nas@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary ones .
i would re@@ write it this way : not not the stron@@ gest of its kind , and not the most intelligent of its species , but the one that change change at the pt .
this is true of la@@ y@@ es thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess as everyone else .
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enter@@ pris@@ es that they make us un@@ inse@@ cure about the pro@@ tual state of mind -- in a way that other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
right now , we &apos;re growing ma@@ n on cor@@ n &apos;re losing losing 11 and thir@@ 30 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of ogra@@ ms per he@@ c@@ tar@@ es , or re-@@ calcul@@ te on the square meter .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ ts would which one one for growth more opti@@ mal com@@ position for faster than others and integr@@ ated more and more chemicals of out@@ comes and divi@@ ded faster .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works like this : when our goal ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the common good of our citizens , , mostly , most , it goes by ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual .
we have fu@@ els from two and third generation , which will come relatively soon that will have much higher sugar skills , like oc@@ tan@@ ium or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
the second thing is that , since because of this arch@@ a@@ model , , we are able to speak very , very or@@ or@@ , even though we use a co@@ ded language today .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that conne@@ associated the autis@@ m epidemic with mas@@ ses , mu@@ mp@@ s , and ro@@ man v@@ acc@@ ine .
if you look at the story of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were in a concept of a natur@@ alist world .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we go on the way we &apos;ve been gu@@ il@@ ty of something we don &apos;t &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will disc@@ uss whether you want to study experience happiness , or whether you want to study life re@@ view , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
so think if it wasn &apos;t only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to anti@@ pre@@ to ce genetic adap@@ tations , the cure cure and cur@@ end the disease .
drin@@ king water , vi@@ ble land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they disappe@@ ar , that &apos;s soon soon , and if we don &apos;t inno@@ v@@ ate from this chaos , we &apos;re going to disappe@@ ar ate .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds that work , as well when their approach@@ es work that can be pro@@ mot@@ ing for their pil@@ ots for it .
we start starting to which we store the &apos;s voice two two sequen@@ , , and and organi@@ ze it in a row , we exp@@ exp@@ and it and add a little bit more of the voice .
and my friends , who make , giant hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful so successful at the brand part@@ ners they have .
but then the whole thing be just a 3d cloud of ima@@ ging that you can go to and move move through which you can look from many , many direc@@ tions .
now , if we to com@@ com@@ sa@@ te the systems that control di@@ bs and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
now , after i cho@@ se government , i know that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ at@@ ori@@ ories that are the most magazine cover time people of the year .
you you see who we were and and how life sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have have come into our lives would have have come us into the outside .
so we set it to to the top of the time , to spend a consi@@ der@@ able money sum to get an commercial action , to get the truth about coal .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this six@@ pack be@@ er with grab@@ bed my sister and sister and went and went to the forest .
so these communities started to evol@@ ve , so the level in which evolution took on was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community , which we call organis@@ m .
the us@@ data is trans@@ fer@@ into into gra@@ y box , com@@ dama@@ ating the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear energy program del@@ a@@ yed -- as@@ as@@ per@@ formed .
we have to deal with with the un@@ stopp@@ able able separ@@ ation through death , and so it should not surprise us that we all be sing@@ ing , dance and bring out out .
i have have a company makes design and anima@@ tions , gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex complex part of what ad@@ re and pay attention in the art world .
&quot; don , i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow so far out in the sea that you didn &apos;t cont@@ amin@@ ate the environment .
that means , if we look at that we can trans@@ mit exi@@ sting models of action from one to something else , the metaphor , i can make myself explo@@ it as a shape .
and the phase that this happened when we we took this piece of chemical chemical and we it it to a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteri@@ um started reading the genetic code and made the vi@@ ral particles .
so , very exciting processes , which is then in this , yes , gra@@ y , it &apos;s actually not , but here is in this cru@@ ute mass just just d@@ ingly .
and the wind@@ wind facili@@ plant or the solar system or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system , or there &apos;s a system , which can eat in small quanti@@ unts here .
and that is a of of our vision our vision of a reas@@ on@@ able energy energy supply , and i &apos;m d@@ le-@@ to cra@@ d@@ le also gr@@ ate@@ ful that they said , use solar energy .
first of all , we put in@@ in@@ sur@@ ance on the do@@ ors , and actually got a device that for temp@@ t that he can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
and funny funny , it &apos;s developed in the &apos; 7@@ 0s at b@@ b@@ c man@@ man@@ heim home , was ab@@ today , has was developed and was been cen@@ sor@@ ed to the japanese .
so i &apos;m suggest@@ ing if you &apos;re going to get evil , you &apos;ll look away the away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what i &apos;m going , i &apos;m going to make the first hot part in the back .
but to me , in inter@@ active media , and it &apos;s particularly impres@@ sive that that , by se by our biological memory memory , the ability to think non@@ lin@@ ear .
and part of me wonder@@ wondering , what if the content of a person@@ ality would be something that could be machine read@@ able could be done through using f@@ mr@@ i ?
two years later , i had service in the emergen@@ cy station in a commun@@ it@@ al hospital north of tor@@ onto , and i looked at a 25 year-old man with rich@@ ed ra@@ cks .
the auth@@ or of the book &apos;s story@@ story@@ telling , jon@@ a@@ than god all , , we still still ded ded a thou@@ thousand hours a year with the reci@@ pe of stories .
but i &apos;ll bet him play play with a soil res@@ ge taught a very valuable lesson , which is the big things that don &apos;t just let you go , and that they stay in a place .
and we b@@ ent around the corner , and we were off@@ of the most incredible view , thousands and thousands of thousands pin@@ pin@@ ush fl@@ amin@@ gos , literally literally p@@ ker car@@ pet pet as far as the eye .
and we &apos;re just to make out that you can de@@ constru@@ ct the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity , by also bringing electro@@ chemical stor@@ age into the net .
how big would it actually have to be a battery battery battery for you to get an island like this island on 20 , 30 , , 3@@ ty , 50 50 , maybe even 7@@ ty percent of rene@@ w@@ ables .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t be work on in@@ sur@@ ance at all because you might make you la@@ zy so to eat , because you know you &apos;re going to save you heart surgery .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i was where where i studied in my ph@@ .@@ al why we better in games than in in real life .
play is a for@@ pe@@ ani@@ er , and it can take a of forms , some of which are a more quie@@ t , fan@@ t@@ ci@@ ci@@ , curious , curious -- maybe to dete@@ ct this ast@@ on@@ ishing again .
so here have a whole par@@ alle@@ l education way , where young people learn the what it means to be a good player as anything else that they learn at school .
and the reasons for this is that , , first by medicine , is managed to be able to get a lot of genes that otherwise otherwise sel@@ ec@@ ted and and have been taken out of the population .
and at the end of the day , i pac@@ bed my stuff , i put the hospital , and i went to the par@@ king lot to drive the car home when i did something that i otherwise &apos;t otherwise do .
my father , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember remember a situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist , was asked if he was afraid to be chem@@ sts .
so if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t me because i &apos;m a good citi@@ zen .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vi@@ bra@@ it at the same time and not vi@@ bra@@ te -- something that that is only in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in different ways and in different places of research -- that you can just apply in your business .
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , fortun@@ e produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to do close social nets , an ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that all i &apos;m going to be is jud@@ now by jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after my last success of my last book , right ?
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i talked to do with muse@@ ums and art , and my ch@@ f@@ in , who is today , gave me the green light .
and it wasn &apos;t when he got 19 years that he received enough medical problems , in fact , because he was im@@ men@@ uring inside that the doctors found that he was female in female .
i have the impres@@ sion that if we make vac@@ ation , it is very common the case , which means we make vac@@ ation ation lar@@ gely ently in the service of memory itself .
just the things that are ei@@ led , like sho@@ e so@@ , like bra@@ ke bra@@ xes , like auth@@ ors , who have to be so that they go to biological systems .
do i get it right ? your software to you that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are are basically connected together ?
we can look at our kids play foot@@ ball , and we have our cell phone on the p a hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry to others , and we probably had our laptop on our la@@ p .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s question question have &apos;ve de@@ vot@@ ed vot@@ my work last few years at the institute for the future .
so it &apos;s just like it in hollywood movies where during the tracking ch@@ ase , the v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce camera is f@@ ed before seen video foot@@ ots .
that means , ning , if you know that , now , look look at who you &apos;re looking at like long , because i &apos;m not going to take ele@@ sen for what &apos;s going to happen accor@@ the ingly .
so the people who cho@@ se to participa@@ te than the more possibilities they had , the more they avo@@ i@@ it sto@@ via and f@@ on@@ ds .
and so my pri@@ mate ra@@ des , let &apos;s hu@@ hu@@ g this gift of evolution and as we re@@ discover creativity the com@@ ra@@ ship and the wonder .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment recor@@ ds of van@@ van@@ gu@@ ard , who giant fund society of about a million collabor@@ employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
we find all species of species here that took a second chromo@@ some , or a third of ad@@ ding thousands of characteri@@ stics in just a second to a species .
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have frequ@@ ent , bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ual sex , changing part@@ ners , and they &apos;re conflict confli@@ cts and social angel@@ ties .
and of course , that may sound crazy in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re moving physi@@ physi@@ move moving not exi@@ sting , virtual worl@@ ds , just the model of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .
it doesn &apos;t difference . it doesn &apos;t makes no difference , because believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see what what we believe what causes us make to feel real .
so i came up with the need to just put out a check , and instead i put out a check that i didn &apos;t have the easi@@ est idea to to to ve it .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages as languages mathematics or mathematics or lo@@ gic games , where we want to give people the possibility of fast er@@ ror , and we &apos;ll see the results immediately .
if we don &apos;t treat a human ho@@ li@@ sti@@ cally , and &apos;t percei@@ ve all its forces and recogni@@ knowledge it , we in addition to the natural struggle that they might have to lead , another disease .
we &apos;re in games to get out of everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all all that is un@@ satis@@ fying in real life , and we &apos;re cat@@ ling what we need out of play .
and the third is concent@@ focus illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affect well-@@ being without war@@ stor@@ ting meaning .
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ tin@@ es , and the fe@@ atures of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
these are the first shoes you can put the ca@@ v@@ ali@@ er@@ laun@@ on the de@@ stri@@ stri@@ and the b@@ ber ber into biological cycle , right ?
maybe the concept that &apos;s that is just attention to what &apos;s broken , and how we re@@ pair it , for every greater dis@@ ability than each individual than path@@ ology on itself .
tele@@ ony , computers , video c@@ , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all of our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms we built in our community hand@@ le this information .
there &apos;s a lot of oper@@ ations that like like to look themselves in america , especially in a place with a free s zone , and there are a lot lot of people who would like to live there .
the beauty is about the issue that on this island today , you can take everything from problems that problems will will get if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables .
and i &apos;m going to play back with na@@ than@@ iel , whether in the wal@@ t , dis@@ ney conc@@ conc@@ out hall or sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ t that is the thing we have , and what we pay for , be something that works against us , something something else , and then we es@@ cap@@ ed ourselves .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish that was deli@@ deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin of fish . i don &apos;t like sau@@ ck it . i don &apos;t like a cr@@ un@@ y .
so if somebody wants a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right there .
a project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land itself that we wanted to make something called an op@@ tical tra@@ p or an op@@ tical br@@ c@@ et .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , suff@@ ered a break@@ down and 30 years later he lived as hom@@ eless lived on the streets of sk@@ id in the center of los angeles .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew only of my mother &apos;s tives about that day , because i course , of course , typical , late to late to my birthday .
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine that are very similar to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , me@@ e tr@@ yp@@ yp@@ in 5 and metho@@ x@@ y@@ y@@ me@@ yp@@ e tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
now , the ex@@ act relationship between a carbon rise , and this makes the resul@@ ting temperature change , and where the impli@@ consequences are , there &apos;s some ambi@@ gu@@ ties , but not very many .
thro@@ pping this po@@ der is sort of being pping out of a g@@ f@@ ated by b@@ aro@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it &apos;s in the games online .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future , if we take democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- to think less about the individual body in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
if in an environment where adults ac@@ make music , or at least ac@@ hear music a child gro@@ ws up , it &apos;s quite easy for a music teacher , what color has your flo@@ wer ?
the average for most of them is about about in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students , half of them , law@@ yers a little more , but not much , kinder@@ garten kids are better than the adults .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the survi@@ ving self and the happiness of of memory itself has been recogni@@ zed in the last few years , and now you try to measure the two separ@@ ation .
every dollar was been mit@@ ned ed and was put into more english and mathematics no matter what we had to pay for for it , and the the new things that always came out of two hand .
you &apos;re not but something that that you put in the morning and gives you an extra strength to you you and will be going to increase your speed , and that will help do , for example , keeping your balance .
i just want to go with him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t -- i saw ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t all the paraly@@ zed people with these devices ? &quot;
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main prof@@ ession as a film@@ maker in hollywood , and i will become fully explor@@ ers for a while . &quot;
now , there &apos;s high gradu@@ tions , whether you learn it for the , , you understand you understand passi@@ vely , or you can speak active , to the musical mother &apos;s speak@@ ers .
and if that fun@@ f@@ th@@ also po@@ ins ates over human man , it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that can only live , just with sou@@ l .
the small thing that we felt ed was that we asked people people to just think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they killed money .
now you might think that the problem of looking at people who certainly when they lived in predat@@ ory societies , were killing animals and only aware of a few generations what they had done .
well , of course , in a way of acci@@ dents again , again about the value of science and engineering on such like this . it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct this .
so , i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we we had to have to do this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the to to take our country forward .
and to be honest , the only real and rema@@ ining dis@@ ability that i had had to ble with with is that the world world constantly thinks it could describe me with these defini@@ tions .
and there &apos;s another nur@@ se said , not the sister had seen after a woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me and those three words that &apos;m afraid of most emergen@@ cy physi@@ cians i know .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of i@@ pa@@ ds and we see an anima@@ tion of aug@@ mented reality reality coming appear on a front of the house .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper copy of a magazine or a a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several sc@@ ales .
this is the greatest time you ever ever been on this planet no no matter what scale you make : health , rich@@ ness , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ lin@@ ing disease .
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they went down together , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repe@@ ated more often and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution .
but the other thing is , we believe that when we see every day , that the c@@ up we &apos;re thro@@ wing doesn &apos;t just disappe@@ ar , that it &apos;s still on on the planet .
now the transition site is where where these communities come together so close that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain on the dna .
now , the most bra@@ in@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between the gene@@ tically ly changing food and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
this in the picture on the top left you see bio@@ curious , this is a ha@@ cker@@ space , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , non@@ profit facili@@ ty ty where everyone can come .
it started with a question of the ma@@ yo@@ r who came to us and and said that spa@@ in and southern deu@@ europe have a beautiful tradition , in public places , to use water as part of architecture .
us@@ ability always means , how can i achieve quickly a certain target , or how a users possibly be effective in a particular context , efficient and satis@@ factory achieve a goal ?
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent sal@@ alt water , two percent hur@@ ties , and we &apos;re fighting by 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but here there is hope .
this year , for the first time , managed to reduce the cost of solar power in india , to 50 percent of the same electricity -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
so if we go back to software area , here &apos;s the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct taking months to deal with these systems .
and even though you &apos;re all turned off every minute in which we &apos;re looking at our child di@@ mu@@ l@@ ating a foot@@ ball game , we asking ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
there &apos;s no distin@@ ction for technology and design that allows allows us to be human and human long as we don &apos;t have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , sel@@ distin@@ y and in@@ justice .
she made me aware of this tele@@ ence experience that being use such robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars and her own consciousness into the vehicle into this other form of existence .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans didn &apos;t listen less about si@@ ou@@ x when they were bo@@ w and ar@@ row of the americans stopped to being americans than they were hor@@ ses and hor@@ cars .
somehow , i have to find from now to to way way to keep a safe distance in a a distance between me and my very natural sti@@ b about how the response will be to the written level .
so if transpor@@ tation technology would go on as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology would go on , then we could go the morning into a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo .
if you may just believe you &apos;re a lo@@ lo@@ -- from an uni@@ mag@@ ei@@ able source for a re@@ reading time of your life passed on to somebody when you &apos;re done with it .
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative partici@@ pat@@ ory communities , completely un@@ expected , are the fe@@ atures of a new kind of media and culture that has that has has access to which the audience becomes popul@@ popular .
and there probably probably pretty much the har@@ dest repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of the street art will be there -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y y , ca@@ ws -- all these guys are going to be there .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just sit front with it , they set up a lab and look at what you can do when this lab proto@@ col@@ s .
they represent parts of human imagination that go back back past past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children part of the geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
and this is the reason we make music : so that we can transform something in all of us , is deep inside , our emotions , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , can shape our creativity to reality .
i want you to imagine something now , a port@@ able robot that gives you over@@ human cap@@ abilities , or another wheel@@ chair driver to stand up and go .
without her support , she , she worried for a sen@@ sation by bringing him to court and was cla@@ ter in her own case , and a greater conversation than she won .
do you realize that we can take advantage of this and we can represent the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um to produce produce the human insu@@ lin &apos;s protein , which is being used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic ?
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever dro@@ ger from &quot; the greatest movie ever , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the greatest movie sold . &quot;
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ uring ed three foun@@ ft@@ ers as color po@@ ts , and i can use it to po@@ po@@ ur paint in the middle of the middle where they &apos;re mix@@ ed up .
so today i want kind of take you on a journey on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a short journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere to try you understand what actually been lost .
the cool@@ est thing about is -- and it inclu@@ ses the circle -- that there will be this apri@@ l mo@@ ca inside down@@ angeles , will be a exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
what happens obviously obviously is that money not &apos;t you an experience happiness , but that lack of money certainly makes you mis@@ er@@ able , and we can measure this mis@@ ery , very clear .
an interesting con@@ sequence of inter@@ actions that that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures to data , like colors out the way to do it with liquid ids .
we should use the ti@@ tivity ures to get re@@ ction to the way , the less we em@@ it@@ ted , the co2 sum will be , and therefore the temperature .
it &apos;s based on the great research in cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with spending mo@@ arb@@ ful study of any subject to to 21@@ 21@@ st year , we &apos;re going to master in it .
this year , we cele@@ te te the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , , darwin , in my eyes , points to something very true in the human character .
so when i look around this room and i see people who have either achie@@ ed to a success , or are on their way , i want to offer the following memory , don &apos;t wait .
it unless you &apos;re very short before a co@@ cost , and you just fund the learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much che@@ aper .
they went away from explan@@ ations of super@@ natural way , and ved things like an over@@ natural concept of power , back where trans@@ mission is on a very va@@ th concept of birth .
the re@@ defined defined doctor is a human being to his humanity , accep@@ ts it , is not proud of making er@@ r@@ ors , but puts all about it out of them so that it can be passed on .
but a particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik michael &apos;s the top , noticed something different else , and that was that the resi@@ dents were doing the si@@ de@@ wal@@ sha@@ ding right in front of these parts .
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an it@@ al@@ o american whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t know pt cor@@ rec@@ tly , so he was always called dr. p@@ . .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text , and it &apos;s not an image , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of text and it &apos;s not no image .
it can generate a thousand gall@@ ons of clean drin@@ king water a day from different sources -- whether s@@ alt water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all of that for less than two cents a li@@ on .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have over@@ over@@ la@@ p other other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build build smaller sub-@@ un@@ its to fit them together .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed as car@@ l has shown , the technology that allows us to work for every minute from every day on the planet every day -- to the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ re in my hospital would have taken somebody the wrong leg , you believe me i had trouble at it in the eyes .
he &apos;s still associated , because of his earlier stories , associated with the skep@@ tic@@ camp , but he &apos;s understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group group , and so &apos;s going to get the research argument .
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ fro@@ r two months ago the s@@ wis@@ s con@@ to of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and on this account was 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
and once you have one way like that , to feel that tri@@ set in other people , you do , because you &apos;ll make others be happy if that them if you don &apos;t remember your self-@@ lies .
but we wri@@ ters seem to have this kind of call , but not just the wri@@ ters , but the creative tives of all rest es seem to have this repu@@ tation to be ment@@ ally incredibly un@@ stable .
the dro@@ pp@@ er ac@@ tively ments on the gra@@ y box when a special con@@ figu@@ ration was discovered was discovered , even if the specific program that &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct trying to infe@@ ct on that goal .
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ate goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the entire pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry , which is right , if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else , to become a main source of energy .
and so you get an idea that if you go through information in this information , tar@@ ge@@ ted , wi@@ der , zo@@ zo@@ zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just look , you you don &apos;t just brow@@ se .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the power of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at every moment , and it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to to syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some to actually , which allows us to v@@ ary the individual components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
so we extra@@ cted and com@@ posed the code of attac@@ sive code , and we found that it &apos;s struc@@ tured into two digital digital war@@ heads a a a smaller and a larger one .
and now , from this sou@@ l , you think that you &apos;re of in this nature of nature , in this funny nature , anim@@ a , called in the la@@ tin , the f@@ f@@ th@@ , is present .
today , for the the first time -- and the campaign showed ob@@ am@@ as this -- we can change from the digital world , from the self-@@ organized forces of networks to the physical world .
instead than it &apos;s just quie@@ t there , vi@@ br@@ ated it . the way it vi@@ br@@ ated was sort of like this -- like an stre@@ and@@ d-@@ exp@@ and@@ ing and combin@@ co@@ d@@ der bal@@ d@@ ine .
if the stupid di@@ v@@ ine geni@@ us that &apos;s set to your side , for a brief moment to show a bri@@ bit of wonder through your effort , ment , chinese ol@@ Ã© .
but the nin@@ e-@@ largest super@@ market , which today is nin@@ e-@@ largest super@@ in the world is al@@ di , and they &apos;re only off@@ ering them 1,@@ 400 products -- some kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ sen .
the ter@@ ra@@ power@@ concept means that , instead instead having part of the ur@@ of ur@@ an , the one percent , u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is is u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
and i used this graph to show show how cious ro@@ hl@@ and is is in a place like new york , remember that a surface is in some cases per square meter worth thousands of dollars .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought on the beach bo@@ ar@@ ade of ven@@ ice , a cop@@ per wire es and and some things from the hard@@ market and the electr@@ on@@ ics trade .
and if you talk to people if you talk people to exist , if you say that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there at all , they get re@@ fin@@ ed and ho@@ sti@@ le .
in fact , i was was so lot of self-@@ certain@@ ty that i asked the nur@@ se , was car@@ care of prin@@ ter for the woman , do you you think it &apos;s okay when she goes home ? &quot;
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re at the same same size , and yet our perception is changing depen@@ ding in what context we put things in .
o@@ sit o@@ sit is about to &apos;s about 50 to a thousand from us ever to activity , so in sleep , you realize that it &apos;s fewer often pun@@ ated than a day .
so every morning i jum@@ ped to my w@@ eless wa@@ age , and people are talking to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch just fer to have a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ a . &quot;
we all know that the inter@@ active media are definition non@@ lin@@ ear , which des the reason of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what of course tells us us that we feel the lin@@ ity normal today .
as the first one is done , when it runs ks as promis@@ ed , it &apos;s all very clear because the econom@@ ies , the energy den@@ sity is different different nuclear energy as we know it .
now if you look at the extre@@ mes , the plans that off@@ ered two fund , they had a sub@@ tion tion in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want to .
this is what the future might look like with change , the tree can acceler@@ ated today with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ tes .
and that question should ask all of you on every single day that you &apos;ll notice of something that needs to be be done . if not now , when if if not me , who then ?
so i started a company , together , with my good friend , stan win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ up up and cre@@ at@@ u@@ re-@@ designers , which was called digital do@@ main .
if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people have been so tou@@ ched by it -- apart from the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ tas@@ history , why were they so tou@@ ched by the image world ?
if you become more intui@@ tive , and then i have to pun@@ ish and see my little friend here and look see it , what does that mean from the point of cognitive tion gon@@ om@@ y , when is really , that &apos;s something intui@@ tive ?
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ used the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was based based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
of course , the designers are not just about per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cogni@@ tion@@ ser@@ om@@ y , but , of course , with the theme of human obje@@ ctive relationship .
because of different success@@ es in the light sector , with other other au@@ tot@@ es , through new ways in dom@@ esti@@ ing , there are many services , which energy energy have some individual services reduce 90 percent .
it was like the time was standing still and the dan@@ cer ki@@ ck through a kind of form . he did nothing else than he had ever done it before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything was su@@ bled together .
and if i say computer game , you &apos;re very likely to realize that some people are cking around in front of some con@@ sol@@ or or playing with some con@@ so@@ le in your hand .
they created up 1@@ 1,000 he@@ c@@ tar@@ es of fish -- bar@@ k , se@@ af@@ o@@ c , sh@@ ri@@ te@@ l , a@@ al -- and mi@@ gu@@ el have mi@@ gu@@ el his his completely rever@@ ver@@ the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i , you &apos;ve s@@ nu@@ ot@@ ing this stuff , this sub@@ stance , which you con@@ tains of different species also metho@@ d@@ y@@ me@@ than@@ e tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
both of them &apos;s not too late to start out to see if you can &apos;t , or to learn how to use these little mus@@ cles that hi@@ re the vo@@ cal cor@@ ch@@ ds ly .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and she came to me , and she took me by her hand , and she said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and i &apos;ve got to talk . &quot;
i live a job from building computers computers , and i know that i was mechan@@ mechan@@ mechan@@ i &apos;m using to build computers not not use without the recently recently made ces in computer technology .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , you and i and i are developed like bo@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the genetic fra@@ ks the next stage of of the orbit and and dro@@ drop down to the sea .
there &apos;s a research direction that ge@@ o@@ engineering called which is with different techniques to del@@ ay warming warming so we can get 20 or 30 years longer to run us up .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so so many people who have opened my do@@ ors rather than en@@ ing people who con@@ stra@@ me me or to me an idea of it .
i go to my photographs of these ic@@ e@@ berg as if i make portra@@ its of my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of that way and will never exist back like this .
that is to say , there could be something , on average , female fe@@ &apos;s &apos;s brains from male , that more attention to highly complex social relationships , and al@@ ert to for the the for prote@@ ctive .
each of these techniques that i describe to you today is meant to help you manage the opportunities -- well for you , you you can use them for yourself , good for the people they provide service .
now we can take more closer . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in in ri@@ ri@@ s , and stuff can help millions of millions of people ex@@ ding their lives .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came to many times , but let fo@@ by the death coura@@ ty of men on our boat , or on on the out@@ flu@@ ation of the engine who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
first of all , for kids in the u.s. , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the over@@ of time that they spend in school from from 5@@ th grade fif@@ th grade to high school school school school -- if you never l@@ ac@@ .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life of the future generations -- not just for soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ chair dri@@ vers , but for everyone .
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end end of vac@@ vac@@ ation are all de@@ va@@ st@@ up , and you get a am@@ nes@@ i@@ d@@ ous drug so you won &apos;t remember anything .
then i take the same patient with breast est , i swe@@ swe@@ and and h , and i give a slightly al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ ated breath to it , and all a sudden the story is re@@ ated with con@@ temp@@ t .
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life that dri@@ fi@@ ves coura@@ ge@@ ly every wave , the in@@ un@@ san@@ , ste@@ ste@@ ous tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the wide hori@@ zon , which &apos;s guar@@ an@@ tee anything ?
b@@ g : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s like you eat too too ate , and just stand before a heart attack . then what do you do ? you might need heart surgery or something like that .
and i started with this brief , and the head@@ line was , &quot; contra@@ ct , my poor , 14@@ -year-old -year-old black mand@@ tal@@ ds like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ year-old top man@@ gers . g@@ ying . &quot;
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alterna@@ alterna@@ about , it &apos;s just to imagine attra@@ ctive properties of of alterna@@ tives that ex@@ clu@@ de you , that makes you less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives that you cho@@ se .
in other words , they &apos;ve found in this human@@ less , evolutionary , evolutionary way to allowed them to write down what they made of , so this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
as we keep driving our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly to get into a zone of the dis@@ comfort where we have to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve probably too stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time &apos;re going to see a slo@@ pe by 1.@@ 3 .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us be@@ be@@ like no@@ no@@ ts to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds around the world .
this is a important step forward forward , but it &apos;s like a faster of re@@ actor and some countries have built built built this , so anyone who &apos;s imple@@ ment@@ red a quick re@@ actor , a can@@ di@@ date date for our first ones .
so for example , texas decided at one point that to mar@@ ry a man means you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and you have a woman means that you have an y chromo@@ some .
none of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , was ried , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , was ac@@ ai i don &apos;t even even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it &apos;s ating .
what lo@@ gic of this de@@ ception , , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , a different reality than the one that know , actually know , in the un@@ conscious that it is val@@ id , to spread to the outside .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things ri@@ vers now tend to lead them , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , of p@@ est control fighting fighting .
but here was a world that i could actually walk in here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as all the that i had always imag@@ ined i had read these books .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and he &apos;s like , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ thy , this guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;
if something about what en@@ allow our society in our society to make decisions about the societies in which would would people people too wi@@ ted , not only would en@@ improve people &apos;s lives lives , but our dig@@ ni@@ ty would also be impro@@ ved .
the idea is quite simple . four@@ -@@ teams need to build the biggest possible liber@@ ding structure with sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ meter ta@@ pe , to build about 1@@ m thre@@ ad and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look sites at it -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or optimi@@ ze these processes to make oc@@ tan@@ ium , or drugs make new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change with just small team more molecular biology than science over the last 20 years .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically building ll@@ ing sounds of me hop@@ ing to create a similar conf@@ used idea in your head that has a certain kind of res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce with my original idea .
otherwise , i ask you , , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , my first question for today is , are you ready to hear about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem ?
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection that i think is ves us to be only not to be open to all the bright and enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic things , but also for the dark and proble@@ matic .
the result is that somebody like me actually have a brain , that was more more ro@@ genes ex@@ ex@@ posed than than a woman born with te@@ sti@@ cles and has a and@@ ro@@ e re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
so what they suddenly to understanding -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a bro@@ ad problem .
m@@ d : this world ? i think your own world is the world you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and so on .
i didn &apos;t take the hearing up and i did what i should , which would been a call with my su@@ ch@@ er to to ari@@ fy it with him so that he would have a chance to take his own image .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always very good at the in@@ u@@ it , and during the 50 years in the years of the establi@@ shed of our rule , they were forced to move in l@@ le@@ ments .
now , as a basic eline question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a basic eline question which is the thing to think about , which en@@ ables all of these choices choices in the industri@@ alized societies , the material is wealth .
remember that a large fra@@ tion of americans living under the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , mobile phones , have condi@@ tion@@ cies and cars .
meat trade and the dec@@ line of the of the tree causes it causes you to to fill fill sta@@ dium on with the rema@@ ded bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- -- even there we we not not trying to be honest .
you can , through the smart grid , you can go by building nets , yes , anyway way you should do that , you can the fra@@ tion , but you &apos;ll never be get ed ed stor@@ age .
that means the ball in the outside field , it comes up , it &apos;s not going to caught , and who tried the ball to to the first base , he didn &apos;t in time , and the run@@ ner was safe .
climate de@@ gra@@ dation is that means rates their see@@ ats won going to grow over many years , we we rain too much or too little , things things are going to the way it can &apos;t keep their fra@@ gi@@ le environment .
the little spr@@ t@@ takes over a cas@@ ka@@ de , and turns ps turns the ro@@ tors tors and slo@@ ws them and the big war@@ in with six cas@@ c@@ des in interaction and mani@@ pul@@ ated val@@ ves .
because in this verb@@ al landscape descri@@ ption , the fra@@ in of flo@@ wers is not smell to smell the degree of the green , only to to the the us@@ ping of the wind , not to feel feel .
but there are symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , why is anyone anyone give anybody these kind a little ch@@ p where it &apos;s dly ely fit fit anyway , so hor@@ ror su@@ ms of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
this si@@ si@@ er is designed for the video re@@ tion , and if i put it in a direction of ti@@ p , the video is being played forward , if i ki@@ p it in the other direction , it will go back@@ wards .
a few weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its ris@@ d , and gave them some designers who had no technical experience what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and them them , &quot; does something . &quot;
at arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria , the chromo@@ some is the cell is but recently recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of one chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
you see the picture of the place cir@@ mas@@ sim@@ o , where since the ro@@ man time , people go to celebra@@ te -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
but more importantly about this ap@@ p is that it represents a new generation that pac@@ ack@@ le the problem of government -- not as the problem problem of a sal@@ tional institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that that how we are coming like this , also the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um kol@@ a , you that you can be a collective again and you use solar energy energy , here &apos;s a little together .
here are also bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ ks , the motor drive is on on their hi@@ p , as well like your k@@ nee jo@@ in@@ ts that they move forward in this fairly smo@@ oth and and very natural way .
so finally a society is not measu@@ measu@@ red by how they tre@@ ats their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but about how to deal with the the poor , the con@@ vi@@ cted , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
the ic@@ e@@ gs around me were ra@@ on almost 60 y@@ ards out of the water , and i could only wonder that was a s@@ no@@ fla@@ ke on a different s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
all of this ro@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , and the strange about these large houses where talked , because of the mis@@ s@@ sts six or seven languages , is that you never hear anyone who learn a language .
as you keep frame a happy happy new day , even ever with with same ritu@@ ritu@@ als of life up , break@@ fast , going to work , i &apos;m doing doing the same piece .
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to fight with the really difficult question , when when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation in which we don &apos;t have have simple simple categ@@ ories as we used to .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and respect for the return .
i ar@@ red the x-@@ ra@@ ys of kid@@ ne@@ ys ney and when that was any fin@@ fund , my collea@@ gue set up on the patient &apos;s re@@ den@@ den@@ ing in the lower right sector , and i called the oper@@ ators .
and the exciting exciting about this , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , is re@@ je@@ ing to a lots many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ical patterns of thinking from the tri@@ b@@ al society .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that , i hope , in in ison with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to to try to create some connections , if you don &apos;t noticed them .
so we have the concept that being a woman is about to have a female identity , being a black person , is , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of their own history .
i grew up again day a day older that change seas@@ ons , my pul@@ se is slo@@ wer at night than the morning , in a conc@@ ert ium takes takes for the sound to come back than it at home .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can able making pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you a piece of do , the mistakes er@@ ors happen .
but over time , as a interpre@@ , you have a rich rich knowledge of the com@@ pos@@ ers you play more often , and it &apos;s easier and easier to think in and feel into it .
it &apos;s about people people to understand the difference between possibilities need to understand what consequences are associated with the individual op@@ possibilities , and and these consequences need to vi@@ vid and con@@ cre@@ te .
i want to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people , over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from from imag@@ ining your own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
it turns out that on top of the weg@@ man &apos;s super@@ markets and the bottom in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , it var@@ ies the number between 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of maga@@ zin@@ es of zin@@ es up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es .
but with this lo@@ gic that just uses to that two sent@@ ences are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect , and atta@@ related to a third that looks like he &apos;s had something to do something with it , so that we can save our li@@ ars .
another thing from the united states , which has to do with this father est story is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , that &apos;s the poly@@ mer chain response , complicated word .
i ad@@ mit , i wasn &apos;t very interested in when a friend told me to be me to look at this great video about a guy prote@@ in new york against pun@@ ti@@ cket for bi@@ cy@@ cles .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citi@@ zen who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that is one answer to an answer to the company mem@@ o about the leg@@ lation of fin@@ ance re@@ form .
so i pre@@ tend to to do the whole thing to ger@@ man , because if i had to trans@@ late it to english , it would be equivalent to me about trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
and one of the ideas that were covered at mit in a labor cycle ce was , imagine this tu@@ bes , and val@@ ves , magnetic val@@ ves , they ve val@@ ves that open and clo@@ close .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close up with my er@@ ors and talk about them , if i agree agree the quie@@ t , which tells me what really couldn &apos;t find happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
but in our game , instead of just five people , say , everybody &apos;s in the dre@@ am team , and it &apos;s our job creating the future , energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago ago what called called state stro@@ j@@ er , which was a tro@@ j@@ used by ger@@ man govern@@ ance to to p@@ p@@ le their own citizens .
and what we looked at at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ off@@ off@@ ers who had a reti@@ sav@@ plan was possible , the 40@@ 1 plan , affec@@ ts the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood whether more being being saved for tomorrow .
so you can see what slow this mechan@@ ism are resol@@ ving , and what the tra@@ ces that it &apos;s leaving behind &apos;s doing something something else than this to this great image of ourselves , i want to you a another story .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one , and married them them as fast as they could , and then as children got children as they could .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer films where there is the dre@@ am team , and they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ str@@ str@@ fl@@ ding , and only together they can save the world .
and last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government government , , i asked one of the sen@@ of this group ask the question of whether he made it possible that because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ha@@ ck people died .
i put a check in my po@@ cket , put on the ted organization top organization , the sa@@ pl@@ foundation -- a check a check of $ 7@@ 100 to fin@@ ance my ted in the next year .
it &apos;s also easier if do it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ tes as we are : you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us in and you give another another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about the lon@@ lon@@ .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would actually be legi@@ ti@@ ted scientific dou@@ dou@@ bt about the idea of -- -- basically -- fe@@ a@@ thers that track people follow use f@@ f@@ d to their projects and etc .
today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as an tation -- the best thing you can ever hope for is that things are as good as they &apos;re expect to be .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens to the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less tr@@ ash with this method -- then you take it and you put it in the next re@@ actor and you keep burn it .
and we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other bs , bar@@ to@@ k to es@@ es@@ a-@@ pe@@ c@@ ka sal@@ ons .
you see , when i was a kid , and my dad wi@@ caught me lying -- and he &apos;s sitting and looking at me look at this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three ver@@ sions in every story .
and if you say that these are the things that will as@@ sure ance good food , somebody stands up and says and they says , , &quot; hey people , i love p@@ p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend currently with playing , it just makes sense when when you hold time in terms of of of the scale of human development , which is extra@@ ordin@@ arily .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , it &apos;s now colle@@ colle@@ cted data from all -- from the whole collective stor@@ age of what , of what , visu@@ ally earth looks like -- and everything is connected to each other .
i did a little bit , talked to some known at the met , and actually figured figured out that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ a@@ il il , where a gan@@ s is be@@ hit on the fast time day with a stick .
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ the next morning , when the dan@@ cer wa@@ kes up and reali@@ that it &apos;s 11 o clock on a tu@@ es@@ day -- and no longer has a five th of god .
and of course , by@@ product , all of this are im@@ men@@ se virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that were not only given by over@@ pping or satelli@@ te images and so on , but by collective stor@@ age .
we often talk about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries that hit in the flo@@ wer@@ ing of their life -- 20@@ &apos; 3@@ 0s , &apos; 4@@ 0s -- by dest@@ in@@ y , and the wheel@@ chair is the only option .
to get that right , it means deep deep in the soil almost like a ver@@ tical colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , , this used ur@@ ans , and then the process starts on the top and continu@@ es to go down ?
and yet this horri@@ ble fa@@ te actually happens to somebody somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every every two weeks , an el@@ der@@ ly ly dies and takes the last sil@@ ables of it to the gra@@ ve .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have any time , somebody takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and you &apos;re it it ently to the top , they a step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da ! &quot; ad@@ mi@@ re your work .
and now we &apos;re getting to the next generation , and the exciting exciting is and a change of generation change is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at this in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re doing to happen .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , terms of the windows part part the the of the part , he made of coun@@ t@@ less cer@@ o@@ - on y@@ - wa@@ lights re use .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i &apos;ve never anything to do with gener@@ gener@@ c@@ tional technology , but i just just cap@@ tured something something and surro@@ und myself with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
so , that &apos;s stopp@@ on the right , , increase the core cause of is just to increase this avail@@ ability of technology , and also to ment@@ ment the information and the pre@@ hen@@ hen@@ sion , that more people can be enga@@ ged there .
and the coal stri@@ ments and oil stri@@ stri@@ have spent a quar@@ ter billion dollars last cal@@ end@@ dar@@ to mote clean coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself .
while they realized out how to stick your hands out and gra@@ b the blocks blocks and moves , they actually learned to think and problems with understanding and solve spa@@ tial context .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe universe , life is only measu@@ red for brie@@ fly , the animal king@@ dom , like a single beat , and human life , a little emergen@@ cy deli@@ ation .
the other volunte@@ er , who was just ely in front of me -- let &apos;s him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- reach@@ ed the main man , first first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the house ow@@ ner@@ ship .
because that i can access the things like the bits , touch touch , and it come up to me , is much more natural when over hier@@ arch@@ ically organized web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms to kind of make available to these things .
now if i want to record a different technology , say , a transpor@@ tation technology , it would come in the se@@ mi@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale , very ir@@ rational rational in the form of a flat line .
one of the things that i learned from the x prize , that small teams that are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , that that large companies and governments could only create in the past .
or what you normally normally understand under a lab , which is kind of ri@@ ri@@ al machines , extremely expensive , extremely distance , for profession@@ als , trained acade@@ acade@@ cs with ph@@ .@@ d. and so on .
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re standing on the th@@ res@@ hold this new generation of value to interaction with digital media that bringing information to our world that mat@@ to our dem@@ ands .
the gall@@ up organization has a worldwide survey that &apos;s been asked where more than half a million people have asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other other ts to go way .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who , on average is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the question that &apos;re supposed to wear more equipment .
look at clo@@ cis@@ sely at the eastern pacific , from the american continent the western and western and both of the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dra@@ dra@@ stic dec@@ line of the oxygen in the ocean .
he hat@@ bed outside , he dro@@ his pants down from his of sea ob@@ r@@ r and he he at@@ ed into his into his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started free@@ zing , he for@@ ped ped them into the form of a car .
i sat there one day , and listen@@ ed to these women , and after a few hours , , par@@ ks turned to me around us , &quot; well br@@ y@@ an , tell me what what the &quot; initiative initiative is the same right .
maybe the tremendous advan@@ v@@ ance acceler@@ ating last we &apos;ve &apos;ve has done through a series of forces , has up so strong that we can be us in the next three decades to create a world of over@@ flow .
but if you leave the shape where you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , into a smaller p@@ ill , and color those blue and and shape a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ ably effective .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it hit med me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i was important to record a work in aids organizations .
and he &apos;s got a kind of this , one of this a a brain wave re@@ re@@ device , so e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g , or something like that , so he &apos;s been dealing with neuro@@ biology , his &apos;s his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
it should be our goal that if families are thinking about where they want to live and work , has given them a opportunity to sele@@ ct between at least one hand of different cities , that are all in competi@@ tive for new resi@@ dents .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program that and and then you can ho@@ ck it , like that , and that &apos;s what i find i find incredibly fascinating fascinating , and i just wanted to go deeper with that .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying trying all of these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i read the business -- -- and i say the truth -- with the best pas@@ je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had .
so i gave another one with facts filled filled talk that inclu@@ des a graph like this attemp@@ trying to cate that if you want to create a lot in a city , it has to be a very big city .
you get get to su@@ amount of money , and here can dis@@ reas@@ on@@ able people , if you have something that &apos;s &apos;t not economic , and you can try fin@@ ance that , and for me , &apos;s it &apos;s the most of it .
the game industry creates con@@ sol@@ es that save energy and work on mobile phones rather than the broad@@ band internet , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
and we know that right the just doesn &apos;t makes to try to look 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything &apos;s going to be so different different that a simple calcu@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing now doesn not make sense sense .
some of us may have decided to be one of these mes , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks look something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te that &apos;s at the same time in both he@@ mis@@ ph@@ aries .
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which , from no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a university student at the washington , consu@@ l@@ ting by steve sei@@ tz at the u@@ w .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and brea@@ collap@@ together , you can use your iphone , and over the next few weeks , your micro@@ software cell over your trying to find the next a@@ ed that can save lives .
okay ? there we were , and we ought us through the we@@ t@@ lands and i c@@ ke and swe@@ ats , i have mu@@ d to mu@@ d to my k@@ ne@@ , and mi@@ gu@@ el is la@@ tain@@ ing a biology lec@@ ture .
but if we &apos;re able to have an effective windows virus , on a laptop , that is used by a waiting engineer to con@@ con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , we &apos;re in the business .
so , first of all , when you get one these online games , especially the world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters willing to trust you a world mission , right away .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and an@@ gry : steve le@@ vi@@ tt told you yesterday about how these expensive expensive and hard to inst@@ all car se@@ ats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no have amin@@ , he under@@ under@@ ves tremendous , because the water flo@@ ws through this farm comes from from of gu@@ ad@@ al@@ vi@@ r river .
especially in today &apos;s world world , at this section of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of of be in in this new exciting en@@ ga@@ tion tool that makes the crow@@ ses bring that message .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big important things we need to do together , everybody together together , are we going going to be be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands hands ?
this is a state in which heart failed , instead of pump@@ ing ing whole blood continu@@ es , some part of the blood is ts in the blood in your lung , and it fill that m@@ m@@ ally , so the shor@@ th@@ li@@ ty came .
but actually , this note of the things that we do is not completely to the big redu@@ ctions , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for this break@@ through@@ s .
before the background , i &apos;ve just bus@@ y looking at , what does it mean , what &apos;s still natural for us , what have we lost , what is instin@@ c@@ tively for us us for us , so what makes the difference ?
imagine you could have little heli@@ cop@@ cop@@ ters can fly through the air , and each of you with a little image of shif@@ ting light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
but if we can able to support the human mind to continue hop@@ ing for ourselves and other people around them beautiful , curious and fan@@ t@@ ful , we really em@@ ment our forces positive .
and when i heard her ch@@ est to the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a stru@@ ck sound on both sides , which told me they suff@@ ered con@@ ge@@ ge@@ er heart failure .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ tops , but now no longer a metaphor of physical object , but a metaphor of a metaphor of a action pattern , a trade principle .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i in the nor@@ the@@ ast of of ecu@@ ad@@ or , an amazing people people who have been pe@@ ac@@ ful time in 195@@ 8 .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t t the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want , we &apos;re being formed by al@@ al@@ style of evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
after these expedi@@ tions , we started what we had seen down there , really appreci@@ ate , for example , these deep@@ -@@ sea y@@ y@@ , where we saw these incredibly amazing amazing , and these are sort sort of ali@@ ens , but here on the ar@@ earth .
we should not den@@ value those challen@@ challen@@ ging times or den@@ i@@ y , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , or or we should come them under the car@@ pet , it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing opportunities in the ad@@ ds of ments .
they use tools like the state stra@@ j@@ to occu@@ pi@@ le their your computer with a tro@@ j@@ er who allows you to monit@@ or or their entire communication , , listen ing their online discus@@ sions , colle@@ their pas@@ s@@ words .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could con@@ fin@@ ct it to big , but by and large whole , the something that we need to give up and we &apos;re going to take the complicated perspective we have to take on what well-@@ being is .
this published a published last study last month that shows that , by the end of this decade in the sun@@ ny areas of the u.s. , solar six cents a k@@ w@@ , compared to 15 cents 15 cents on the national average .
and that may surprising to something because my ful@@ l-@@ time engagement at the foundation main@@ gely about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds well about the things things we need to inv@@ ent and provide to allow the poor@@ est 2 billion a better life .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to pre@@ mi@@ um@@ -@@ col@@ a person , that re@@ ili@@ ili@@ ated the word the again again , because after the ma@@ ck , you weren &apos;t allowed to use the word anymore , the left was bad .
we &apos;re out teams around the world to connect all these technologies to each other in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device because because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with ai , you can test rein@@ hu@@ you or test your blood values .
and what we &apos;ve done , about thou@@ sand@@ sand@@ nine , the hall has finished finished , all this ti@@ by two thousand or 12 , basically anything that was between the single system the single system to develop software , we &apos;ve done .
there are ad@@ vi@@ ence and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just real , and each person is different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re with with happiness or not , but how we deal with it .
and they would be so dee@@ pen@@ ed into the cu@@ ce , because games are so fascinating and surro@@ surro@@ und us with satis@@ fying , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity tivity that they would forget forget that there was nothing to eat .
the model is already jum@@ ped in the wom@@ b , and is inter@@ tur@@ ally , so it works in young in the world and old , and it &apos;s used all the time without most of us known that this model was present .
but i have to understand , the core , in nature , when as information comes to information , when from data information information from information , again , so know how to make things intui@@ tively things things as as or course pal@@ ge@@ able .
and this said , hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , wel@@ come transpar@@ ency , they were pres@@ ented by my good friends from em@@ c $ 7@@ 100 100 for tional rights on e@@ bay .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that days , drive down down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
and i also changed my thinking over the course of time , if you asked me at the age of 15 whether i had swa@@ pped my pro@@ s@@ thetic against legs of meat and b@@ ones then i would not have del@@ a@@ yed for a second .
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind is a mind that has broken broken has no hope . he can &apos;t find more beautiful . he l@@ ks our natural , childhood curi@@ , and our in@@ na@@ te ability of imagination .
you invi@@ te d.@@ n@@ .@@ a on gold particles , and then you bring the gold particles into these air pi@@ gun , and then i sho@@ ot@@ the the on on on , and then made them the to with it .
the second thing i learned on that day -- and that was when we mis@@ doing the george washington washington bridge was pretty much about ar@@ es@@ wide -- because i thought , , man , there &apos;s one thing i &apos;m really re@@ gre@@ t .
. i sus@@ pe@@ ct you can see that these are many different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything is from the cell phone camera to the professional sl@@ rs , a fairly large number of you that have been fli@@ ak@@ ed together in this environment .
and right after that , on janu@@ 19@@ 19@@ th , they were con@@ gress for con@@ gress for changing in the const@@ it@@ ution to have a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive policy policy that is reli@@ able to special development areas .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow driven driven by determin@@ driven in nature are determin@@ ed by the larger pi@@ es , that are ct you on immediately , then they quickly feel that there feel that there must be something like a free will .
and it &apos;s just about to grown up with software , but there &apos;s also in the electr@@ on@@ ics area , there &apos;s also a whole tin@@ ker@@ ing scene that do with electr@@ on@@ ics circu@@ its , all kinds of things ur@@ able things .
we actually created a reality then six months later where i found myself in a russi@@ an di@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and looked at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll eye .
in my atom@@ atom@@ ic ture , i learned the orig@@ ins and cas@@ run@@ ners of each mus@@ k@@ , every bran@@ ch of any ar@@ tery that gui@@ away off the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis .
now that the notes represents everything else but an accu@@ rate record of the cause of com@@ pos@@ er , but &apos;s just a aff@@ ol@@ old , i &apos;m now turning this sc@@ aff@@ old to to it it sense and meaning .
we &apos;ve put six different ta@@ vor@@ s of mel@@ ade or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of mar@@ mel@@ ade , and we looked at two things : first of all fact , what case would more people stand and try mar@@ in@@ ade ?
now , this is a trick that i often teach little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn learn a lot about de@@ ception when you look more , though it &apos;s a very simple ecu@@ sive trick .
and then analy@@ tical techni@@ que , the same motor of science that can en@@ the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to say super@@ -@@ at@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity capacity -- better memory .
and what you can do with that , and also you tar@@ ge@@ ted to go to ask and ask , okay , you know , what do you want to do it , have you interest in bringing you like that ?
well , i &apos;m sitting there , on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve , and i &apos;m planning to see the these guys pretty much like these keys here , and i know that the band the band has been played there .
now the film &apos;t &apos;t any money , in fact he was just doing his production costs , but i noticed noticed something that was this : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic that went from it .
if i know something takes three seconds to to to sort to sort , the , from the present into the loo@@ p , i can also do very good at which i to doing it with doing time in three seconds .
from the her@@ vor@@ ved itself , if you have vac@@ ation , , and the second week is just as good as the first , the second week week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the im@@ week vac@@ ation .
but what happens , almost always , is that the ta@@ -@@ da &apos;s going to be a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws causes the whole thing thing b@@ ds and cr@@ as@@ hes .
but one thing will happen . you you you think you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you think about you &apos;re remin@@ ded of how terrible the weather in o@@ hi@@ o was , and you &apos;ll feel that you made the right decision .
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel was re@@ je@@ cted a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electro@@ sho@@ cks and treated with th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , a trau@@ ma that tra@@ su@@ him it his entire life .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is is with europe , and a co@@ operation in based in india , but that now now members members or active people around the world .
we built a website and we asked a crowd mass of people , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please share share with where it is when he &apos;s got , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business are , of course .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who saw he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but for to adop@@ t the tsun@@ am@@ ic silicon .
just because of the fact that mar@@ was born three months fru@@ ely , she ands all kinds of rights to go three months before h@@ ein@@ rich -- having this rather conven@@ i@@ ve sex , choose the right to drink the right .
and then it goes forward , because it &apos;s at the back of the front of it , and it says , do please look again , and make sure you if what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave back their families to go work for se@@ chen@@ -- sometimes it &apos;s single mothers mothers who have to make enough enough money to afford food and clo@@ thing .
but the question is quite simple , if you make completely independent of any fossil ls or pri@@ mal energy age that are dri@@ ll@@ ed somewhere in the world and to them , you &apos;re an island .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the dig@@ ried between in the terrible in the short term and thinking people are , between the u.s. and china , between the and stre@@ rich , and almost all all of these two billion will be much worse .
look at this interesting stati@@ stic that was recently published by a resear@@ cher car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person of today in a country with stron@@ -@@ d game culture has 10,000 hours with online games to 21@@ st life year .
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tal , that has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to see if we can do it with a even smaller genome .
b@@ g : yeah . now you to to re@@ fill the re@@ actor , , so there &apos;s a lot of a lot of contro@@ ls ls that can go wrong -- this thing where you open it it in or bringing them . that &apos;s not good .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every day where one out of 10 media cations are either do@@ ged a fal@@ se or wrong in the hospital infe@@ ctions and always more nu@@ mer@@ ous and cause de@@ va@@ station or dead .
where i had had the most exc@@ it@@ ement recently was south south african run@@ li@@ er in ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , last year , who was asked by the ch@@ ch@@ le@@ thi@@ ic world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in ber@@ lin .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is that they can &apos;t be taken im@@ m@@ ally , because they &apos;re den@@ ri@@ red by a of course , the human enzy@@ me called mon@@ o@@ me called mon@@ o@@ am@@ in o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
if you get evil -- if you just fall to as@@ power -- i showed this to a couple of friends last night in the hotel room some people people i didn &apos;t , and a woman has almost almost power@@ power@@ powerful .
a lot of ancient societies , including one of the gre@@ e@@ ks and the man , really believed that the language of a es@@ flight has a great force because what you speak out out l@@ oud oud can mani@@ fest themselves .
and if these tools become more physical physical develop conscious awareness for their mov@@ ements , recognize each other and see the intri@@ c@@ ac@@ ies of our approach , then we can start with explor@@ new new and entertain@@ ment interaction actions .
but as the already quot@@ ed examples of the syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language has no room a imagine imagine something we would all want : en@@ allow anyone to think of ourselves as a powerful person .
they were sh@@ in@@ y photos of them from the air , which we would ev@@ ju@@ to as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure , and they for@@ got that these people had out of the rain@@ forest never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they left ly@@ di@@ ya , and they went the search for a new home , and they just left as many people back as there was food food to survival , were looked for the rest of an area where they could fl@@ our@@ ish .
here &apos;s a emotional shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve by we using these processes -- in fact , we just use ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of pieces , we f@@ f@@ them them . ye@@ ast auto@@ matically ad@@ ds them together .
and in the very ma@@ travel stage , na@@ than@@ iel , when we started out with our first education lesson in wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall and he had he lost this re fl@@ ck@@ les in his eyes and completely lost .
i want to say that i probably probably some of light lab@@ ra@@ dor@@ village dogs that are more that are more more intelligent , intelligent and more ri@@ in decisions of their sexual relationships than some of 4@@ 0-@@ year-old i know .
maybe you &apos;ve actually saved your people through play by wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into games for 18 years and then that that titude and learned so much about play with each other by re@@ cu@@ saving the entire civilization .
in one case you may somebody have a x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ es top@@ basis , and the s@@ ry gene of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s the proto@@ gon@@ ads that we all all have fe@@ tal st@@ are are growing to te@@ sti@@ tu@@ up .
what could be more powerful than being being by sil@@ ence , being one of the last of your people your language speak your language , to have the wisdom of the wisdom of ancestors , or hope to expect children ?
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d , and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds -- and this was at a time when we actually actually ste@@ lief water .
anyone who &apos;s not dist@@ crimin@@ ish these terms is scre@@ up the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m in listening to a lot of researchers on well-@@ being who have been mas@@ ed the exploration of happiness , in that very same way .
there was any law@@ yer or or a ture ste@@ wards who was now for the rest of his life , could tell people that he went to a burning house , to save living living , just because it was five seconds faster than me .
years ago , when i was an graduate school , one of my graduate vis@@ vis@@ asked me , who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , who was what it still do -- a really strange question .
and my nose was put in a book , a science fi@@ ction book that kid@@ formed my thoughts into other worl@@ ds and nar@@ er@@ tive ser@@ fied my deep inside sitting , sa@@ aci@@ able curi@@ osity .
a few years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in into a food market in this nor@@ red zone in the nor@@ the@@ ast pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there a a fo@@ el to@@ ma@@ et .
so these are the three major groups : crimin@@ als who are &apos;re doing for for money , ha@@ ck@@ sts sts like anony@@ mous who do resi@@ stance , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attac@@ ks .
and in this fol@@ der was notes notes in a ger@@ m company that , the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government sold some programs that they could catch -- in very large frame@@ work -- any communication of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
the other hat that i car@@ n in my work work is the activ@@ ist , as a patient law@@ yer -- or , as i sometimes say , as im@@ patient law@@ yer -- of people who are doctors cian patients .
because what it out out is , if you offer plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill in the shape of as@@ pi@@ in@@ tab@@ tab@@ ill , that &apos;s just a round , , white p@@ ill that has a particular meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
oper@@ ators that are not worl@@ ds for themselves , businesses that re@@ stor@@ cate rather than using ing rather , businesses , that grow exten@@ si@@ vely , rather than just inten@@ sive , farmers that are not only gener@@ ators , but experts for relationships .
as i said , i went to some some of terrible situations over the years of the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ me , nothing could stir@@ take me to do something as difficult and as dangerous as these guys into a room .
but that &apos;s the c@@ est thing that can happen , because this is the pe@@ er pressure , groups pressure , to help patients , because this could be used used against o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could be patients re@@ re@@ i@@ ct the smo@@ ke .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new com@@ er , new in the image -- and not just okay , but but something you have to be gr@@ ate@@ for , maybe a gift of the boat .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , which i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and getting this this way a very different map , virtual map from a very real city .
if we get to these really large ap@@ ges -- over 100,000 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they don &apos;t just grow in e@@ . col@@ i . it beyond the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
and dr. ke@@ an told on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that , if they don &apos;t say something else all the time , and even if they only get a little support if you leave kids yourself , kids can do a lot . &quot;
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve written this information together with bacteria bacteria into dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria , which are bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ lin because the bacteria communicate communic@@ other with each other .
now let me introdu@@ ce you to ele@@ gs being car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , suff@@ ered a spin@@ al cor@@ d 19 years ago , which has a result result that it could not walk for 19 years and years so far .
something interesting happened at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a a narra@@ tive problem in this film -- and we had to create create a kind of liquid water beings -- -- we ked to computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
and i want to say something that is a bit radical to a fe@@ min@@ ist and i think there might be be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that gover@@ n by different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , , especially when people apply group group thinking .
for example , take this kid of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of of ama@@ ama@@ zon , the an@@ a@@ kon@@ da da , believe that believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally , came ed the da@@ ir@@ river from the east in the bel@@ ly ly the hol@@ the hol@@ red sna@@ kes .
we turned the light off , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um , and we su@@ cked up all the air and cool@@ ed it until almost in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the piece of metal was free to have like it wanted .
together , the coun@@ t@@ less cultures in the form a net of spi@@ ritual and cultural life that wra@@ ps ps the earth and as important for the earth is as important as the biological web that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
but because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can den@@ y it , and and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and teach mes@@ sages from fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live .
coal coal evolution pus@@ hed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century there was a ra@@ pid case in electricity , and so we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tion@@ ers , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
in other services , like making ferti@@ li@@ li@@ z@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 00 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- &amp; gt ; 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic or air traffic , is the m for impro@@ v@@ ements is much much smaller .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her min@@ ght-@@ person@@ ght-@@ are separ@@ ated two , but has supp@@ ment@@ ary pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck brand is an ei@@ ght-@@ th / played brand .
because in the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you you see it from the back , that fing@@ ers is moving here my ti@@ inde@@ finger , just just from where it was , into a position where it &apos;s so stre@@ t@@ out .
not to burn the ligh@@ ge mu@@ d a little bit better and lau@@ ying it , and in the the in@@ bu@@ bu@@ bu@@ , , , losing all the materials for cy@@ cles , but to ask first , how do you inclu@@ the cy@@ cles ?
that is , i actually &apos;ve spo@@ ded them along the , is that you no longer see a pattern in the middle , but i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned it in a very short period of time of time , to see this dog in this kind ob@@ red red image .
and i left medical school with the impres@@ sion that i , if i memor@@ i@@ everything out and knew everything , , or at as much as possible , as the complete process as possible that that i im@@ mu@@ une to making the mistakes .
and then if i go one step further into this natural natural user inter@@ faces , where i by voice , by language , by touch , by gest@@ ure , a mouse and cur@@ sor , need to control things things , i &apos;m even faster and even more immedi@@ ate .
we see this , when i turn things up , then i can conf@@ use them like on the right right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ bu@@ er , or i can of design them by showing things .
now if i look at all these people , i realize that most of them government offi@@ ci@@ als , some of them come from science . some , less come from the economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss , and one thing comes from the music zone .
i study studying molecular biology and i &apos;ve been been involved with bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now now and and i started because i just wanted to know more carefully , and and do it myself , which i learned learned this in study theore@@ tically .
we need solutions , either one or several who have an uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able scale and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able ability , and even there are direc@@ tions where people are looking for it , i really see only only five that can afford these big dem@@ ands .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a cen@@ su@@ decision on-@@ in in this is about actually doing a effort to actually der@@ d@@ ting something from the stream of the money that otherwise ws into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
that means you &apos;ve found out by talking to a common language , you could communicate communicate each each other , has moved to the same ca@@ ve or other other areas , formed cities or villa@@ villa@@ ges , and sort of created like tri@@ b@@ al society .
most women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ some structure , but i think i probably have the typical one -- most women like i actually talk to and@@ ro@@ gens .
if you en@@ able someone to activ@@ ate their own , inner forces -- the human mind is so re@@ ception ded -- if you can that , and you open a door for somebody at a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they en@@ powered us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing as tell the story in this film that today you use mr@@ is to address ct the pleasure centers the brain , both to make adverti@@ sing and films .
i &apos;m out a cre@@ house , so of course , &apos;m looking with the subject of curi@@ osity of curi@@ , and how curi@@ osity also re@@ change our thinking , and why why we also lose curi@@ osity , and and i have to re@@ pel it back on and so on .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if if we over@@ come paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less content with the result of of choice than if if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
now , not to decide a glass of mel@@ ade is probably good good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ -- but it turns out out the decisi@@ on-@@ making over@@ load problem also ts us in very con@@ sequen@@ cing decisions .
i don &apos;t have to stick ce these things ally because right right around the corner , there will always be another color@@ ful , radi@@ aming out@@ fit , which just waiting for me if i love a little bit in the heart and search for it .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands lands when i went to in@@ u@@ its to the nar@@ wh@@ al-@@ h@@ , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid a real dead alle@@ y , and it kee@@ ps millions of people from fl@@ our@@ ishing .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones who make mistakes and those who don don &apos;t do the ones who con@@ stra@@ the bedro@@ vation and and without con@@ stra@@ stra@@ ining that have bad results and good out@@ comes .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regul@@ ated countries are high , and the question for sure that really really feel nothing can go go wrong despite the human work , that the fuel is &apos;t used for weapons .
and we started to make pieces , starting with pieces that had five to se@@ vent@@ -@@ h letters , ad@@ ded each together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letters pieces them together , up to 7@@ ,000 .
the last example that i have time for today to show it is a musical sequen@@ cer for live shows that we &apos;ve recently developed and in the si@@ ft@@ able as sound like leadership voice , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
immediately after that ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st and 24@@ ary febru@@ ary , a d@@ ele@@ gation travel@@ ed about 30 hun@@ dur@@ an@@ ers to the two places of the world that were most interested in going into the business of the urban b@@ house .
and when , of course , when something intui@@ intui@@ tive , and how can influence influence as a shape and , then , to make things so way they &apos;re that a use , so use , intui@@ tive , so they &apos;re because then they &apos;re fun fun and &apos;re easy to use .
but when i was tele@@ cting with him and asking him why he did these interven@@ tion -- they were highly ris@@ ky sur@@ ger@@ ies -- his answer answer was that in his country , these kids would be very poor@@ treated , and therefore he had to do it .
imagine you live in a certain remote area , and you have a belo@@ ved person with g@@ heart disease , and your hou@@ se@@ doctor pro@@ f@@ ers this to a car@@ di@@ ologist who on average performance is at 200 .
both in my prof@@ ession at ro@@ bin hood and in my side prof@@ ession and a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i wit@@ ness essed gener@@ osity and friend@@ dness at the lar@@ ge-@@ scale , but i also see actions of clo@@ s@@ ism and the pattern of individuals .
so i started thinking , and so i think , certainly in the last few months , while i was working on the book , going to appear soon -- as the dangerous , sc@@ ary , well-@@ expected success@@ of my my ride success .
in urban communities around the country -- from los angeles to phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men are either in sto@@ dy , in ja@@ il on cur@@ ren@@ cy , with condi@@ tional app@@ lic@@ ment .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this technology technology that you &apos;re en@@ counter that it &apos;s actually bringing you into the future , but actually it is that the future is right with us in our arch@@ a@@ al roots .
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate the strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s , which , nearly three million years , , the size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states s@@ hr@@ ink by 40 percent .
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worl@@ ds , like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying at any time on the ver@@ edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory , that we pre@@ fer to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
later on day , i dro@@ ve around mi@@ gu@@ el this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems be so natural , &quot; unlike , &quot; unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succe@@ ed ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came here and looked at this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of eyes . don &apos;t give up . tricks . &quot;
and i definitely know that for me -- -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start wal@@ vering this dark path@@ path of view of say -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m &apos;m myself in my career right now .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with this sentence , i also like to close de giving a and once again , designers , have have to think differently to get to new solutions , and in that sense thank you very very much for your attention and please .
i was always gri@@ ding ing my syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary , but i was already finished with the ed@@ of of text , and i noticed that i never re@@ yed in my life what the word &quot; ab@@ led &quot; really means .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or or the character found nothing and conclu@@ de that that were were business cards of the de@@ vil , and killed the five mis@@ sion@@ ary with the spe@@ ar .
and then if i hold a hal@@ bo@@ val , all of a sudden , don &apos;t &apos;t see just one unit , which circle , circle , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see see three parts , a circle , another circle .
and i &apos;m just holding one of of these little devices up , because things should be more intui@@ tive , more more natural us@@ more friend@@ ly , and you have to watch to look , what is , for us , for humans , what is friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
are you not afraid that you &apos;re through this cra@@ ual your life , and never emer@@ ges anything , and you &apos;re going to die on a bur@@ y@@ ard g@@ dreams -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter as@@ hes of the failure ? hat@@ movie .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of of us turn into our best version , any@@ time and immediately , to be ac@@ p@@ table try to solve the problem , as long as we takes , try after the mis@@ s@@ ke once again .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t re@@ mind that over 20 years ago , when i first told a teenager was a first time it that i wanted to be a writer i was con@@ fron@@ ted the same kind of fear occu@@ pi@@ ed reaction .
and because i was born without wa@@ de legs , and my feet were focused for them , and i was just had a few to@@ es on this one and some to@@ es es the other foot , he was the ab@@ br@@ ers , this stran@@ ger had to get the bad news .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of of people people because he insi@@ sted that red be@@ ds , bone bl@@ ke and le@@ mon oil are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs that we know are be able to slow down the course of aids .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , when i just started with element@@ ary school , and started building and then shape my image of self outside my family , even in terms of other kids and the the world and the the world around me .
it &apos;s a image of the first radiation ining particles that put back all the distance around the l@@ h@@ c , and then inten@@ tion@@ ded ded with part of the l@@ h@@ c , to leave a rain of particles on dete@@ ctor pr@@ en@@ hes .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re called by my common@@ general , so he can see where my weight problem is , not just in the moment i i car@@ di@@ support or support or but with a view of the past .
it &apos;s -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 2@@ 22 times .
and i &apos;m today myself how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl sha@@ ped my self-@@ image , and i could think of myself as a one of nature , powerful , powerful at@@ le@@ th@@ ic man .
they then gave over a three-@@ mon@@ th-@@ period of of students with an enough &quot; the note &quot; very well , &quot; they were told to be that they were very smart , and after those three months they were wrote them lon@@ ones .
and finally , i think that although it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so stimul@@ , we &apos;re not measu@@ red in our technology , not about the things that we develop not in our intelle@@ ct and minds .
and the message is now , we need to give to these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we sort of sense , our goals , 20 t@@ t@@ t@@ 20 percent , 20 , 30 ty , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach those at all .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever , &quot; is that everything , from the top to bottom , from the beginning to the end , is absolutely entirely br@@ ands -- from the cover spon@@ spon@@ sor you &apos;ll see in the movie , that is the brand x .
this was worth sharing myself up all this year in the sau@@ clean space , because , check check this , , the scale difference between a single om and this piece of metal is sort of the same between the difference between metal and them .
if a ac@@ tur@@ er in spa@@ in done something impossible , ma@@ gical : : of al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ Ã© , ol@@ Ã© , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo &apos;s un@@ pre@@ si@@ ble it it : a gli@@ ti@@ le view of god .
and then i stopped it down to six six six 0s , and then we got it together with friends , i became a co-@@ fo@@ under of sol@@ on , which then along with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ cells became one of the world &apos;s largest largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world .
at the time , it was as a mon@@ r@@ t where no@@ del , c@@ er@@ us , and others said , you &apos;re actually in@@ san@@ e , when the people start reading , people want they want to talk to the after@@ wards , and that &apos;s totally f@@ at@@ al .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i put , very fundamental soli@@ d : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell divi@@ de , and all the genetic information of the cell is continu@@ ing lead in both sub@@ si@@ daughter cells .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on earth that we &apos;re saying . there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ ing , no bi@@ ol@@ ol@@ and , no natural wire pro@@ d , and how all of them who allow our own ex@@ cre@@ ments to go back .
the first project we did as an international group , when we became of of of aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , it &apos;s us here as real scene now , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are ch@@ at@@ ting and so on .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed us that every tool that becomes an information technology on the mo@@ je@@ the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law large ap@@ , the price performance qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ent dou@@ ches every 12 to 24 months .
so perhaps this technologi@@ cal change more clearly than ever that there was always a different truth , which is human in society can be something special and very powerful , and the human ability to ada@@ pt our biggest plus .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was , to , to happen slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y happened -- obviously obviously in trying to get war@@ ning engineers , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it quickly .
this is a problem because warming warming is at fro@@ zen reason for arc@@ tic ocean , where there are large amo@@ unts of fro@@ zen carbon , which , if it &apos;s lo@@ mented by micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the ta@@ ta@@ arb@@ ol@@ ins that are contain@@ ed in the li@@ an@@ e are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are just the same way that &apos;s necessary to to power@@ ce the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins , so ask for themselves .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never would be as mo@@ able as other children or that you could never lead an independent life , and since then they just pun@@ ished me lie . &quot;
what if we could fli@@ p this situation and put the internet on its head , so that than than we from going from one to another , we to be able to go to many things , and by by see patterns that would have otherwise lo@@ hidden ?
i started working through scientific liter@@ ature about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are built in nat@@ ance , and found that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in something called cas@@ ka@@ des , and every cas@@ ca@@ de con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
but as we think , the only way biology biology has a huge impact without another increasing vement of food , or the limit@@ ation of its avail@@ ability is if we see co2 as an out@@ tial material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
so what does that mean , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about place in people in evolution , and especially as we &apos;re going to look ahead in the next stage , i would say there are a number of possibilities .
so there are big price challenges here . there are are challenges are trans@@ mission , if we say say the energy source outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the the technology technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from .
i met these guys from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them project a light on any surface that want want , and then draw with a las@@ er poin@@ ter on the , which gover@@ ster@@ ns the negative surface .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might might dis@@ pu@@ ct and use less , but on average , that number will increase every year , so that will double more than double , the number of the services provi@@ ded per person .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up , and i hear all these things , because i don &apos;t want to lt them with it , or , frank@@ ly , they &apos;ll them away .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as ty@@ ran@@ ny of remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remin@@ der itself as one one that sort of dra@@ des the her@@ her@@ itself itself through experiences that earth itself doesn &apos;t need .
and yeah , you you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ gues , so that &apos;s stop of people doing this alone in the home , all to the way to that large , major organizations , doing doing more for@@ times , are already already in institu@@ tion@@ tional form .
and idea idea is , imagine that that we re@@ engage people people with with to do and change the environment -- almost something as we call it cloud in@@ corpo@@ ds movement , you you move a bar@@ om@@ or , but with a cloud .
and for me , the question is , what are we do do because our science makes these advan@@ ces in an@@ atom@@ y , that we get to a point where we need to ad@@ mit there &apos;s a democracy that is based on an@@ atom@@ y ?
&quot; when we f@@ ought in eastern europe to op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do all of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness sometimes in hop@@ hop@@ eless places , to be wit@@ ness . &quot;
ultimately , a con@@ sequence of buying a poor@@ ly je@@ ans if there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you &apos;re wondering why who is responsible the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you me that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t told you that he &apos;s his with x@@ y -- because you assu@@ me he assu@@ that he &apos;s male , he can be dra@@ wn into what mar@@ ia doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
and there &apos;s better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d-@@ d video and photo , libr@@ aries of books and music , technology for medical diagno@@ stics -- are literally de@@ materi@@ zed and che@@ aper in your cell phone .
i gradu@@ ated , and i hope the video the video , brought a very , very beautiful project , which is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ or work work by michael bur@@ k , an@@ n-@@ ka@@ thr@@ thr@@ in kr@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause and jan@@ mor@@ it@@ z du@@ arb@@ er .
now we have &quot; three po@@ is@@ &quot; laws that get people people behind grid forever into ars ars for a bi@@ ke the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft is a good , rather than for@@ them to force them to give back to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ a .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participa@@ tion , and there was an rise in the number of people who were willing to save or or an increase to pay four percent in the amount they were ready to pay the sav@@ ings account .
there &apos;s evidence that the ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , older people and people car@@ people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and that might have happened because the life experience was in the survival of these people were valuable for society .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design and design to take a year off and work in an environment , which is pretty much much everything they actually hate , we &apos;ve let them work in the government .
we look into this web , we see the 50 her@@ tz , and if it &apos;s a nin@@ et@@ y-@@ y comm@@ ma her@@ tz , we &apos;s making up some val@@ ves , then go back in a little mer@@ h ste@@ am , then we &apos;ll back back up .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , we built it apart , we put it a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s free available -- you can build it , ourselves , we can provide the code free , down@@ load load software for free .
it was on a piano cur@@ suit for music students my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ j@@ elt u@@ de , a known bee@@ tho@@ ven@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and long-term professor of music college here in stu@@ school .
but this is how my prototyp@@ e , which is which was pretty much dri@@ t@@ ing , and@@ ing , on a bran@@ ch , which the thing thing on it , electr@@ on@@ ics on it and pressure , and it was , but the pressure was too high , the thing has broken .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking doing doing is doing is , we &apos;re thinking at a certain abstra@@ ct level , giving ding this machine and the machine , make out of it something that out@@ sc@@ end our cap@@ abilities , better and faster than we we ever ever do it .
then the next one , who have been working with ne@@ m neu@@ ral model or mental model like the software of e@@ er@@ gon@@ om@@ a , which is you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , order to use the computer .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be char@@ ged from under the big water , respond to the rhyth@@ m of dance , to dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living over , so that ac@@ oly@@ th th for a short sh@@ sh@@ in@@ y moment to god .
so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ food food , why they believed that molecules were in a random instead of pus@@ hing a over@@ around in the field of nature .
because -- -- at the end , it &apos;s like by . cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the deser@@ of north africa has brought people to the ly with sac@@ red dan@@ cers and music that been re@@ duced for hours -- up to da@@ wn .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ m or si@@ am@@ es@@ an tw@@ ins , be inter@@ sexual -- surge@@ ons are often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ m is not because it would be advan@@ ge@@ ous to their physical health .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; well , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ graph@@ experts , &quot; or any cancer ck@@ ke sal@@ ver who wants to treat his patients with ff@@ li@@ r@@ es .
he contain@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed ed a dis@@ hes , took the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed ed a bad , sp@@ ced up another dog and fl@@ f@@ ged over the ice she@@ ets with the fe@@ cal@@ on kni@@ fe on the b@@ elt .
i &apos;m studied histor@@ ian , and in in this case , i study people people with an@@ atom@@ y -- that is that human bodies , animal bodies -- how they deal with body flu@@ ids , with body concep@@ ts , how they thought about bodies .
so now if i do this , the fil@@ fil@@ ors in the scene , then go go to go , collect ther ther of hair sam@@ ples there , and they they turn this method , and then then you can say , o@@ .@@ k , ok , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to to this person , like this .
now i have to say , when i was a college student , i thought okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for -- it seemed quite reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with every year , it came to my increas@@ ed dou@@ bt .
i commit@@ ted to his place , and to his brother and father -- in the words , &quot; well , my pro@@ pos@@ al is this : : &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to get him a device device , and we &apos;re going to way that he to do his art again .
what you have to do there may perhaps seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;ve have to capture all the co2 that comes coming out of the s@@ or@@ n@@ stone , , the it , ob@@ f@@ ting , and stor@@ ing and stor@@ store somewhere and hope that it stay there .
and like a mira@@ , he took his vi@@ o@@ lin , and he started started playing some cli@@ cli@@ p@@ ts of o@@ o@@ in@@ con@@ cer@@ ts , then he asked me to play them to play it : men@@ men@@ s@@ son , son , t@@ scha@@ i@@ ko@@ w@@ sk@@ i , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
and you can see see that that a , our seven senses , most people we think only five , now , it &apos;s &apos;s even seven recogni@@ zed , and &apos;s certainly certainly in the near future , there &apos;s to the next ei@@ gh@@ th sense , to sense , and as exten@@ exten@@ sion of our self .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ ops glob@@ ally with students , develop@@ develop@@ and and ts c@@ to@@ s of fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ companies , and there &apos;s this task that en@@ ables ables deep impres@@ sions into nature of collaboration , and i want to share with some of them .
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans leaving their country to go out into the united states , and they wanted know what they could do to make sure that these people can people can stay in their country and can do exactly the same in hon@@ dur@@ as .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration sold her 10 at the worst possible at c@@ at diff@@ us , they experienced the prof@@ its ro@@ went by 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of both , the increase of sal@@ es and re@@ duc@@ ing cost .
to make these theor@@ ies , we re@@ ber@@ that it &apos;s definitely a high-@@ grade s@@ ab@@ age , it has to be very quality goal , and very likely in iran because most ctions were sig@@ ned .
this was a huge out@@ c@@ ry back then , because , of course you you started mani@@ fest the language in the form of scri@@ pt , which is what what flu@@ id and is alive , i re@@ start in stone and ma@@ late it into stone and i manipu@@ late it as well .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take to the importance this this problem of this , but there &apos;s a a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering about whether you should have available if things get faster , or need innovation needs longer than we expect .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surge@@ on i talked to a few years ago , who had brought some si@@ es@@ ese tw@@ ins to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name .
what we &apos;ve learned from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- are ds to to give complex social relationships and car@@ ing about people who are vulnerable a lot of attention in the group .
i think they were so bra@@ ve and strong , so so cally where what they were doing every every few years looking at the p@@ f of 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of music music that for@@ forget .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics business business assem@@ ble a stere@@ o system -- the speak@@ ers , c@@ d-@@ player , a c@@ asse@@ tte , , radio radio , stron@@ stron@@ ger . and in this one one on@@ ics business , there are so many stere@@ stere@@ o .
and , , there are things that are totally arrived ed everyday life , which most people are not don &apos;t even aware , for example , was@@ hing enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h at 40 degrees laun@@ , also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
what kinder@@ garten kids do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , prototyp@@ , successful prototyp@@ es , always always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so they have the opportunity to re@@ pair b@@ ou@@ di@@ sive prototyp@@ es .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribu@@ te rights to of people of people , because i have to ad@@ mit mit that i know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ , who are likely deser@@ ve ve social benefits than some people i know .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of proble@@ m-@@ solving around the world , if we t@@ ack@@ le the barri@@ ers of the next century , the face of those who are on the ad@@ vi@@ ence are on the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs is not convin@@ elling , but we think story@@ telling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution in the world . our website gets 35 million a month .
some of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that no one had had seen before before and for science science when we saw them had found no words .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ original itali@@ an , and every boy in al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture in your room , but the reason why i &apos;m going to show you this is is is done in the for@@ mul@@ 1 , done something very interesting in the past few decades .
because i think that inter@@ active media in add@@ res@@ the arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models , so thinking that have been progra@@ mm@@ ed in our ed in our biological memory , very long time time , and that we can re@@ produce them through inter@@ active media .
tan le , anony@@ mous resi@@ dents of foot@@ sc@@ ray , was tan le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist invited to speak to places that she had never of , and hous@@ ing whose existence they could have imag@@ ined .
so we started with some volunte@@ ers who helped us , a little over a year ago in se@@ attle , ging the things they thre@@ w away -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things that they to throw away anyway .
so this whole discussion of how &apos;s going to be moving and now , , the turn of energy , to go , on the island , we example , for example , , fif@@ ty percent ex@@ ex@@ c@@ c@@ ession energy , so we &apos;ve got to elimin@@ ate the wind and the sun .
con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent dis@@ that has an@@ gry for decades and challen@@ ged as many lives as the first world war .
i &apos;m be more about making clear that we don &apos;t necessarily need to over@@ past the ence , but we &apos;re open to the you to hu@@ g you gra@@ pack them on the op@@ ard to use a fight expression , and maybe dan@@ cing with it .
and it turns out that under an income of 6@@ 0,000 a a , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a great repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple , under income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do life life , i was thinking about all the people i wanted to pass one hand and and didn &apos;t do all the f@@ ences i wanted to fli@@ ck , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did them .
so here you have this scen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious that immediately immediately jum@@ ps , without being doing something about it it , and the the things that know know very different very different , so to that you can sound much better for you and for others .
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go to biological systems , if we can change water she@@ stor@@ s , inside inside that they can go back to cell@@ u@@ lo@@ se@@ basis , you can plant with a baby in israel or in hundreds of trees in tun@@ isi@@ a .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- fre@@ ely from de@@ ception and skin , just discover and look through ; watch understand stand@@ mind , characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility and access to information to information , in terms terms of of business business -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
if i took this post seriously , i would be born into a world that would percei@@ ve someone like me as a person who could live posi@@ at at way , but today i &apos;m going to celebra@@ te for the chan@@ ces and ad@@ vent@@ ure i experienced have experienced .
so , she runs out to the house , looking for paper , and the po@@ em goes through her , and she &apos;s grab@@ s a cil as she wal@@ through through her , and then then -- she said , it was like it was reach@@ ing with her other hand and getting gra@@ b it .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better like that ? &quot; &apos;t &apos;t world a better place a better place if we all talk a language ? &quot; and i &apos;m , , &quot; well , let that language be yor@@ u@@ ba . let it be can@@ ic .
and before the background , i was in the real@@ m of natural user design , so the next generation in there human computers in computers in a human computer is working working on how our tools or how computers changes from the computer su@@ essi@@ ve changes to the digital assi@@ stant .
off@@ spring to the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization popul@@ ving the popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ an level of col@@ om@@ bia , and in a result of con@@ qu@@ est , these people moved into an isol@@ ated isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massive vely that ris@@ es above the car@@ ib@@ an pla@@ in .
for example , there &apos;s the an@@ ec@@ d@@ te that that is the report of a chap@@ ter sound that was watching great fish h@@ r in this area in this fish can &apos;t be used , or normally fis@@ fis@@ her@@ scientists scientists scientists &apos;t be adverti@@ ed because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
you know that this isn &apos;t just means people have to eat food food they go to reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means that making making decisions is so hard to give large investment off@@ ers to their emplo@@ yers .
and during that entire time , they &apos;re cul@@ tur@@ ally introduced to the values of society , values that main@@ main@@ tain the cla@@ im that their pra@@ yers and only your pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say , e@@ col@@ o@@ gical e@@ col@@ o@@ gical balance -- susta@@ tain@@ -- balance .
i took them with and i gave them access to the world down there : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who are interested in these extreme situations and i took them to the sources to the sources so they could look around , , take sam@@ ples sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments and so on .
you do it for the task , for the challenge of will -- and ocean is the challen@@ ging environment that is there . you do it the disco@@ ver@@ able way , and because of the strange connection that emer@@ ges when a small group of people forms a team .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it you could actually ex@@ tend the gut refle@@ ction of patient a by just allo@@ wing the tu@@ d in it without too much to it .
and , when i step a step out and look at everything , i can re@@ ar@@ range my lost , maybe after my search past , here , &apos;ve looked for the ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic , &quot; which , looking for bing , or here to live lab@@ s .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you caused the survi@@ vor self of patient a &apos;s worse , and you made the memory patient a be better better , because now you have patient a a better story about his experience .
now this could happen within the lifetime fes@@ of a single organis@@ m , whereas hundreds of thousands of thousands of years , because this information had evolutionary had to be learned by the individuals that died because of these fru@@ it because these information process@@ ing weren &apos;t there there .
how many times have we se a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we re@@ rec@@ la@@ ct , , and we expect government to , ct our values refle@@ cts our values and fil@@ ves our needs , and then we haven &apos;t changed a much ?
that as as trans@@ ator ator , not not just you red trans@@ word to the text into a different language , but you need to understand the deeper sense of words and wor@@ san@@ us@@ ci@@ slo@@ , so that that to make a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation of the it tion know anyone has has have to do with foreign languages .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm meas@@ uring their success at the health of their predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally literally water water process@@ ing plant , not just for these fish fish , also for you and me .
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky who was also a communic@@ ator in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote a es@@ ase ti@@ t@@ led , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense sense in light of evolution . &quot;
and the bottom of the ocean are bacteria , that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and by the hot ste@@ am survive survive otherwise , if fish were there , it would have vac@@ u@@ um to to be fish , , they &apos;ve been able to make a habit@@ able environment for themselves .
what if you could change the sper@@ m and eg@@ cells , or the new@@ ly ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g to give your kids a better chance for a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- -- elimin@@ ation of diabetes , he@@ m@@ li@@ hi@@ cy , reduce the risk of cancer ?
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people is being con@@ vi@@ cted , but eth@@ cial , the destruction of the destruction of human &apos;s yle is not only con@@ vi@@ cted , but generally and generally cele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t see that there are only three fing@@ ers down here : : because the mind and the process process information , doesn &apos;t count it occu@@ cks , one , two , three , but see it as a group .
and there was a time when there was only je@@ ans in a way , they bought it , and they were mis@@ mis@@ poor@@ ly , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable comfortable , and if they had them long enough , and they had had was@@ was@@ many enough , they &apos;ve starting to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
now , what this thing does is it it cat@@ ches off the intri@@ coming values of sensor@@ s -- for example , from pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ legi@@ ti@@ ti@@ mate code that &apos;s during the attack , with wrong ad@@ ding data .
about an hour that she got home at home after finished her home , she collap@@ sed , and the family called 9@@ 11 , and the the res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ brought them back to the emergen@@ cy station station with a blood pressure of , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck state .
but i remember the lights off the oil platform off the mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and on the young man who collap@@ sed and died , end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple apple that me one of the men on the platform .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of str@@ sti@@ ant plants don &apos;t find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally plants that , , if combin@@ bine that way , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that this is larger than the sum of its parts ?
and these sounds and that rhyth@@ m have ge@@ ology , which to@@ po@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , which also , of course , allowed you to frag@@ ment these songs to com@@ bine differently and move differently , to to left , to the right and move back to the image back .
i also think there are theor@@ ies that start to understand how everything with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story about it , which is that at that , oil dro@@ ills around around that ed different kinds of of reci@@ pes for chemicals .
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the best examples that come to the market recently about how to say best the choices that david la@@ ib@@ son &apos;s &apos;s a program a program off@@ ered at harvard .
at this point , patients come into the game . they can &apos;t just take control , cap@@ tain on their own own ship , but they can help help us the health care about the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost health care , double demand , and so on .
this is like he &apos;s looking for for a date , but what he &apos;s looking for is is somebody who fre@@ fre@@ fre@@ ing him up up when he &apos;s just in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the sur@@ and-@@ fi@@ ction when he &apos;s co@@ covered by a meter of s@@ now .
and then there &apos;s a remin@@ der self , and the remin@@ der itself is that who coun@@ ts and recei@@ ps the story of our lives , and it &apos;s one that doctor doctor res@@ ates by asking ging the question , &quot; how did you feel felt recently ? &quot;
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose to ct the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love , or i could could choose that is , which is , hal@@ ved energy cycle without any co2 , and i made that wish sh@@ wish .
but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ map , which is very simple , compared to ours . trust me , this is simple ig@@ , but if we look at all these genes that we elimin@@ ate one after another , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
so ted@@ talk thought in a very simple form that a char@@ city is a place where is a beginning of in@@ hab@@ ited country , a fo@@ unding contra@@ ct that determin@@ es the laws that exist there and people provi@@ ers the opportunity to decide to live under these rules or not .
we followed gene@@ a@@ ology back eight generations and we found two cases of natural death , and and when we asked say pres@@ a something about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the people had become so old that he died of his age , and we still killed him with the spe@@ ar .
these older people are coming to me now saying , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they talk , they give talks . they tell people people need to stop saying that we first first time to do with the history in the history of terror@@ ism after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and in this song , we &apos;re going to discover the possibility of be what we are : people with full consciousness who are of the importance of importance that all all humans and gar@@ gar@@ dens to a space will thri@@ able to be ad@@ fron@@ ed ed , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
so what you got was , your name is pres@@ ented : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea what the subject going to be , and that could ultimately fly on on on content on fly around your e@@ ars , especially if i were to let your company your company for their participa@@ tion stupid .
there are some pilot projects that do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but to get going to 100 percent will be very difficult , and to make an agre@@ ement to shift co2 co2 , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the stor@@ age question .
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let let dan@@ cers of our time -- Ã©@@ toi@@ le at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan tan theater in new york and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ il@@ and -- we &apos;ve taken its mov@@ ements mov@@ ements in 3d to use it as a impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it may strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested interested in it , unless you look at it as me , as &quot; a de@@ ception that becomes something real ted , if somebody only belie@@ ves enough of it . &quot;
people in the back or those those who &apos;ll see see video video later at some time , say say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impres@@ tac@@ sive , but if it was real , it would be -- there &apos;s see , here &apos;s a hole , and if it was really real , it was real , it would ble@@ ed . &quot;
as a result of that , , it &apos;s now pr@@ pr@@ one to these these schizophren@@ ases , they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it disappe@@ ars for days , travel@@ ing around the streets of sk@@ id row , are always ex@@ posed to this hor@@ hor@@ ror and the tor@@ ter@@ ell@@ fish of his own mind .
so if you look at google glas@@ ses , for example , then a concept of what lets us re@@ combin@@ bine with the virtual world with the real world , which means our aff@@ in@@ ity to virtu@@ alization , to feel the virtual as something normal is natural is is add@@ ressed again .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to ad@@ mit that nature for us for us doesn &apos;t dra@@ a line between male and female , or or between male and inter@@ sexu@@ ually and sex@@ and ; sex@@ al , , al , we who give the line line separ@@ course than of course .
and they &apos;ll be heal@@ thi@@ er by the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re trained by the k@@ han ak@@ acade@@ my , and by the able to have the opportunity to use 3d prin@@ ter and infin@@ ite computing and infin@@ ite computing , &quot; and be so much more productive than ever before .
we don &apos;t have a situation , as is , for example , iran is , where a man who feels sex@@ ually attra@@ wn to other men , is pun@@ ished to death , unless he &apos;s ready to be willing to trans@@ mit a sex environment in in which case he can stay alive .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avo@@ ding things where they &apos;re not sure , they avoid fear , these elements , and they wel@@ them , and they actually turn them into something for themselves , and this is a story@@ ill move .
and perhaps a little look at view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore and explore or do other things in all kinds of post-@@ human@@ os that i can of as a science fi@@ ction fan .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we did a few years ago ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had and i think and i think relatively often of to to relation to how many often i think of other vac@@ ation .
the reason for this is , if i draw it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , let say say this are the years , , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a a way , and this is a degree of of technology that i want to show with a graph , then the graph will sil@@ ly .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the idea al of bringing new elements into play -- like the te@@ the te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how the game needs trust and while it makes un@@ men@@ fun at the same time .
so i &apos;m going to describe you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , mir kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang , where we made the decisions for reti@@ re@@ of almost a million americans of about 6@@ 50 places in the entire united states .
the main reason for this is that we may be watching these huge shel@@ ves of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , essi@@ g and mar@@ ade , but we can &apos;t move the compar@@ ons and and can actually choose something from the fantastic deal .
by playing playing music and talking about music , out of this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used man who had just had dra@@ wn through the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ ving , educ@@ ated , exc@@ ell@@ ent , brilliant musi@@ cians in ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the ate modern artist who was trying to master ate this un@@ controll@@ able creative pul@@ ses that lived in him and cop@@ deal with them .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely consi@@ to out how individuals be prote@@ cted from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we brought more mothers into this concept , we could get more a concept of not just how to protect , but how we to worry for each other .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have on memor@@ ps my to@@ es , but even when you do more of it there &apos;s a real question , why do we give memor@@ ies so much weight in the course of the the weight that we give experiences ?
you can think of this cultural life web as a eth@@ no@@ sphere , eth@@ no@@ sphere can be defined as the sum sum of thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths of ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions and intui@@ tions that have been dis@@ ated by the human imagination since the early beginn@@ ings of consciousness .
the leaders of government in hon@@ dur@@ as would have end the help of partner@@ countries , they could benefit from their partner@@ countries that they would support in the during the laws for this char@@ ter and per@@ performance that everybody trust that the char@@ ter is really imple@@ through .
the next weeks , i made bi@@ s@@ ture , and for the first time , i learned the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt like myself , isol@@ ated , not not the kind of healthy sh@@ ame that you feel feeling feel feel feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues colleagues about it .
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house while she was tra@@ by this po@@ em , and it was only she had to get fast enough fast enough to a she@@ et of paper and a pen@@ cil , that it if it could caught it through it through car@@ it it , could capture it and hang it on the she@@ et .
this curi@@ osity also showed that every time whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , through through the sts , , travel@@ ed , travel@@ and &quot; &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; colle@@ ed , fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and be@@ et@@ les and pon@@ d water , all home and and under the microscop@@ e .
but there only one company , an agen@@ cy willing to help us -- and also it just because i know john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to go around the middle man and and go to the companies with my team .
in fact , i &apos;ve set out to most of my career to the living for terrible situations , and all of this is just trying trying to study social in in that they &apos;re eng@@ elling and interesting interesting , and hopefully in a way of acc@@ stand@@ hen@@ hen@@ ble ble that makes you fun and available to the audience .
another example : a few years ago , i got the the call of a 19 man man who was born a boy as a boy , and had a friend , friend had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he had just found out that he had an o@@ var@@ ies and a u@@ ter@@ us .
he dro@@ ve at high speed as he suddenly he@@ ars a frag@@ ment of a mel@@ o@@ dy which , as , is often , is , el@@ m@@ ly ag@@ gi@@ ble to him , and he wants to have . it &apos;s gl@@ ge@@ ous . ous . he brea@@ ts after@@ after@@ it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
these are this has more arti@@ stic direction entation so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and are bus@@ y in working with scientists , putting deal with these technologies and ask questions and and the creative , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and yes , all kinds of things .
now , not exactly what i hop@@ hop@@ ed , but but i went up -- the sta@@ irs , along the hall@@ way , by the real &quot; fire@@ men who at that point in was with the d@@ ele@@ pretty pretty finished into the bedro@@ om to get some shoes .
with the total transpar@@ ency , what the new thinking is , what is ban@@ up the old thinking , don &apos;t say say that in the las@@ ag@@ ne horse meat and no more c@@ cer@@ bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ phenomen@@ a , which , i want to del@@ p this that the thing and i want to bo@@ do that at all .
in my about 20 years of medical awareness and and journ@@ journ@@ alism , i created a personal medical study on on medical mistakes and wrong treat@@ ments learn learn possible for one of my first artic@@ i i wrote for tor@@ onto star to my show , white co@@ at , black art .
and where you see how far we &apos;re away from what we really really wanted to achieve , and how sad we are that that &apos;re &apos;re at earth , for , , you can for example , offen@@ offen@@ b@@ ach has a program , until 20 40 , you want be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , right ?
these may afford a moder@@ ate contribu@@ tion , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core stat@@ ement we have to work on all five on those five , and we can &apos;t give up of them because they sh@@ y us up because all of them have significant problems .
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed through her , and she gave it , and she said it would continue to move across the , and -- as she said , is , made of a po@@ et et looking for hell .
up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fr@@ just like the fresh prin@@ ce , ti@@ mel@@ ine , m@@ ely ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous and loved like er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , agi@@ le and agi@@ le , mr. , ma@@ gical and my@@ stic like gand@@ al@@ f .
fe@@ eding grain of her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , cr@@ p@@ est re@@ a@@ ing in mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken , fish , all the time , the agri@@ cultural industry has just asked , &quot; if if we feed more people che@@ che@@ aper , how horri@@ ble can it be ? &quot;
and problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , but it can just be a access problem , which simpli@@ fy things things , so any any problem , to up a question and how do you do it , or how do you do better .
and ated wind and sun , and the bur@@ den , and they came to the result sion , a very exciting result is , , towards the conven@@ tional conven@@ tional system , you takes a middle power mp after 20 years from about 50 cents a kil@@ 50 cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour , about out at 4@@ 4@@ 40 cents .
and one day he watched me in one of my practic@@ es -- these exercise were just ti@@ ring and and wor@@ eless -- and he said said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to te@@ p one of these ben@@ ands one one day .
but in fact , we see it and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ ct , and get rid of the ir@@ important equal ality , well , there &apos;s a increase of the sal@@ es , it will cost are cre@@ duced , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an impro@@ impro@@ vement in decisi@@ on-@@ perception .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-@@ an africa there was no religious faith , and of course there was one and the vo@@ do@@ o is just the m@@ la of this very profound religious thought that came across during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ ve period .
not through the lat@@ est mo@@ d-@@ res@@ ging and tra@@ c@@ tor inven@@ tions , but through ferti@@ le land , not by pump@@ by pump@@ s , but through fresh water , not through chain sa@@ ws , but through fore@@ sts , but not fore@@ sts , not fis@@ her@@ bo@@ ats and nets nets , but through fish in the sea .
they consu@@ me the pul@@ sive co2 , which leads to temperature , and that temperature incre@@ ases has some very negative consequences . effects effects effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect result that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ada@@ pt such ra@@ pid changes , and collapse whole systems together .
because this self-@@ de@@ de@@ ception , this sense of being great , ance@@ cent from the highest creatures , not from such kind of level , of of something un@@ un@@ table as an organis@@ m that that still exists compar@@ to a stone , and otherwise whatever things that is un@@ sustainable for us .
and that &apos;s , if you forget all of your feelings about politics and the sna@@ at at the work and and all the other things that we really really up@@ set about is government , at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do in common we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
but the process and the heavy sti@@ b that surro@@ unds it was when he picked ted when he out of the geni@@ us out where he caused nothing but trouble and let him back to where he of came in , and it realized not to be an in@@ alized , ment@@ zing thing .
this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called co@@ eat , pra@@ y , love love -- -- which decided , unlike all of my previous books for some reason and became a great me@@ event , international pol@@ st-@@ selling thing .
but in fact , you &apos;d been thinking about it long , but you could never reas@@ simu@@ late if it would work , but there are modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late and see it and see , yes ! with the right materi@@ of ways , it looks like it &apos;s working .
but will found 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to pay up this control , who wanted to do business with somebody as ei@@ ei@@ ful and play@@ play@@ as as me , and eventually en@@ powered us to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have have -- stories that a that a a@@ ers would normally never support .
and our goal was to , we wanted to come to 7@@ 0s to 9@@ nine rene@@ rene@@ w@@ here , and then there &apos;s left with this here , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able with , it , going to become very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work you make it out of bat@@ ter@@ ies .
this may seem a very se at first , so i repe@@ at at it to work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we need trying to play games online at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
i told you about four techniques that are stra@@ ct the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ over@@ over@@ -- -- going to be end the ob@@ so@@ le@@ te alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze them -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze -- we better better deal with more categ@@ ories , less pre@@ p@@ are for complexity .
in our desire to protect people who are care art@@ about telling us to tell them the cold hard truth about their medical for@@ ec@@ , or even even give a ction to quality of life that they would expect , we have to pay attention that we don &apos;t give make the ground that someone is dis@@ ab@@ led .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually used used then a new of network that was used around the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- mobile phone use use use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ gre@@ ated information from this network that are colle@@ cted from the oper@@ ator of , ag@@ , to understand how the city works .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed . we had this this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s put human individual to the center of the universe -- all the go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures to adop@@ ce the comm@@ ands of di@@ v@@ ity .
but we don &apos;t even say if we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve &apos;ve known this kind of ements for so long time , so somehow we &apos;ve accep@@ ted the perception and colle@@ c@@ tively accep@@ ted that creativity and creativity and suffering somehow bel@@ bel@@ ong , and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the se@@ el@@ el@@ qu@@ al .
i wanted to return to r@@ out@@ ine and and the comfort of the life of an un@@ known child -- a , a a and two dau@@ dau@@ ters who who kno@@ cked every of their days as 20 years 20 years by telling and lo@@ sing the stories of their day , we still still in the same bed .
he spoke in a very heal@@ and and dig@@ ated sound about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never get it the the series , and and would all all of all because of the bridge pas@@ sage the first because of the first vi@@ o@@ lin the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
whenever we think of in@@ na@@ gen@@ ous and landscape , we either com@@ pla@@ in r@@ ous@@ se@@ au au the old work of the no@@ ble wild record , which is in its simpli@@ fication , a ra@@ cial thought , or th@@ ore@@ au , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
it would be great if we could exchange this pattern of normal@@ ity to another different of possibilities or the strength , , to for@@ mu@@ late it a little bit more dangerous , , so we can rele@@ ase the forces of very of very many kids , and invi@@ invi@@ te them to bring in their very special and valuable skills to society .
that is , if you focus a las@@ er be@@ am , on the room , then you can capture in little particles in the air or in the air in the liquid , and then in that focus , so that &apos;s &apos;s tured tured , so , like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am , principle .
and i did this in my lab trying to exp@@ tend a little bit bit and and and then i to get out the d-@@ hand sha@@ mor on e@@ bay and did a little bit of n@@ .@@ a , , trying to make a vat@@ &apos;s test , which which is / d.@@ n@@ .@@ a finger@@ prin@@ ting , to to go at the home .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the difficult situation of the na@@ , think of you you an or@@ g@@ ini@@ ell and color@@ ful g , but they are kind con@@ fin@@ to to the past , as the real world , that is , our world , pro@@ gr@@ es .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could percei@@ you a lot more about that , and tell the other wonderful things you you can percei@@ percei@@ dete@@ this , but i want like to get to talk to the second part that we disc@@ uss at the beginning , and that &apos;s the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of our environment .
but if you 2011 a new color las@@ er prin@@ ter in prin@@ ter of the leading las@@ er factory fac@@ tor@@ ies and print out one side , that page has prin@@ bright yellow blo@@ ts on each page on every page , in a pattern that clearly clearly tra@@ ces the page to back to you and your pr@@ inter@@ s .
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ formed the mo@@ ses , it means that at the end took up the ham@@ mer and thre@@ w him on mo@@ ses -- in , they can still see a little location down -- and he said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ Ã© n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
and if you were to choose vac@@ ation , there , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not at all at because if you think in the sense sense of time , you get an answer , and if you think in the sense of memor@@ you could get a different answer .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution that brought us agriculture and brought us at the moment at the cul@@ t of the see@@ ord , creating the poetry of sha@@ ame through the pro@@ pro@@ of of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ ship and hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization and shot -- found only 10,000 years ago .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward the wee@@ k@@ the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ wee@@ fri@@ day , fri@@ day . t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . you wouldn &apos;t have have think we would have that that conversation without talking talking about this video , i hope .
i think a sig@@ scientist -- not the only , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have learned who are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then have to explain these experiences themselves , think it would be your fau@@ lt .
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and it into 10 categ@@ ories or i &apos;ll show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and spli@@ spli@@ t them into 20 categ@@ ories , you think that i gave you more choice and better sele@@ ction experience than i gave you 400 400 if i gave you the 600 .
it really works , this is done in acade@@ mic setting , , and then we thought thought , o@@ . , we might get , and we &apos;ve taken a web@@ c@@ am , which scre@@ w up , scre@@ scre@@ wed the l@@ ens , and you ver@@ ted it , you have a microscop@@ e e , which exp@@ es es about about four hundred of times .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , get get all the big scientists we we did , we need a several 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve te@@ sted our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make make sure that it works reas@@ on@@ able , you only in the 10@@ 0@@ th million .
i mean , most moments of our life -- -- i i ated that -- you know that psych@@ ological pres@@ ence is true true than about three seconds . which means you know that in a life there are about 600 million of them . in a month there are 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . most of you are no tra@@ ce .
the first thing , you you as a child , as a baby , is you you care about what kind of what di@@ ce do you have , right ? and ding on whether your parents allowed them to play more and less in more or less in the po@@ cket the ars , the more , the more , of course , of course , your curi@@ osity is be wo@@ ken ken it .
and then just came from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o or@@ g website on the fo@@ under , and said o@@ .@@ k , , we really have to meet now we also meet real , and then organized organized two events in london , two thousand 10 , and and shor@@ that to the u.s. s@@ .@@ a , in san francisco .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a that i met to a while ago a , who , this is a student group that who like to give vey a stop of the public more , what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve done this in the fix@@ ed small actions and try to people what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
i read this list to a friend l@@ oud and i had to lau@@ gh at first , it worked so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i came &quot; up , &quot; and and &apos;t &apos;t talk , and i had to stop reading and first collect for this over@@ m@@ ding f@@ ding and the cur@@ ding and the emotional sho@@ ck with it .
and president lo@@ bo &apos;s insi@@ ght , was that the certain@@ ty of trans@@ lation that i thought about as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come in and build this city might be equ@@ important to all the par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as in in dur@@ as who suff@@ suffering from fear and mi@@ mi@@ y years .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little pli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- you want to bring to zero , and that will dep@@ end on the number of people , on on the services that every human on average use on average , the average energy for every service and the co2 , is being em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra o@@ live o@@ es and 12 bal@@ sam@@ i@@ co-@@ essi@@ g that you could could buy to make a large number of your sal@@ ad des@@ s@@ ings , where un@@ un@@ likely case that none of the of the 17@@ 5 in the the store is right for you .
what i &apos;m going to show you as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve over microsoft microsoft as part of a trans@@ line just one year ago this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either hand@@ le lo@@ cally or re@@ move with huge amo@@ unts of visual data .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter , and you can come into this this phase , and just came up up a picture picture where i wonder@@ ed , after 10 years , a thousand d mark , that was still , , , bas@@ wa@@ ge , a c@@ te in the collective , of course , whether that should be be the cool thing .
and from a conversation today with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators do it yourself i want to share with something with you -- he gave me per@@ mission -- his engineering called called sl@@ ing@@ shot shot , and a many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator in the graduate age .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to make a over@@ bacteri@@ bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some , and it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we &apos;d building it in a asse@@ tte of the size of the virus that we could could match the size size of the asse@@ asse@@ order to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
i had to repe@@ individual exer@@ cis@@ es to be repe@@ often with these thi@@ ck , el@@ a@@ stic changes -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscle . i hat@@ e@@ ed these ta@@ ands more than anything more than anything else hat@@ ed it . i cur@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
this was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ j@@ stan -@@ v@@ u that &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i each bo@@ w a , i i always knew what was going to show in the light bul@@ one of the vehicle , because , had i for for months on the movie set when we turned the movie .
look at these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in a tran@@ state , which is the glo@@ wing char@@ coal without without burn , which is ast@@ on@@ ishing illu@@ stration of the ability of the mind in influence the body that it &apos;s to to it when it transl@@ placed into a state of extreme ar@@ ou@@ ation .
&quot; clou@@ computing , &quot; something that my friends call at auto@@ des@@ k &quot; infin@@ qu@@ ity computing computing , sensor@@ s and networks , robots , 3d prin@@ ter that en@@ us to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fu@@ els , vac@@ cin@@ ations and food , food , digital medicine , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial intelligence .
and here &apos;s o with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e , like brian de@@ g@@ ger in england england trying to assem@@ ble a minim@@ um ab@@ or , took a a coo@@ of coo@@ , a hot pla@@ te and , , and , yes , like sou@@ p brothers , and then grew bacteria so , worked bacteria .
in this picture , i put out a bush as a center of des@@ per@@ ches in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges ges of life , all the living have exist at the ti@@ kes of these bran@@ ches in these bran@@ ches involved in evolutionary terms of success : they survi@@ ved ; it demon@@ strated fit@@ ness fit@@ ness and strength surro@@ und@@ ings .
if you &apos;ve ever had a chance to work in your city call center , like our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man as part of the program -- in fact , in fact , do this -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call government government on lots lots many different problems , including that a yl@@ yl@@ rat@@ s in their house .
you know , one of the great reas@@ for travel travel and one of the pleas@@ ures at eth@@ eth@@ no@@ graphic research is live live with the people who still remember the old days , still your past still still in the wind wind to touch them on the rain smo@@ y ro@@ ones , taste them in the bit@@ ter pe@@ t@@ als of the plants .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame when you give a secret of best prize secret , even though this one is con@@ sen@@ s@@ s@@ ess , and you get get you and the best friend con@@ front you and have have a terrible discussion , but if you end up doing the bad con@@ science , and you you vo@@ you you never never such a mistake again .
it &apos;s actually the one that made decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , two gut refle@@ ctions at two different surge@@ ons , and then ons deci@@ des des to to vote , then the one who &apos;s choo@@ sing the one who has remin@@ der that &apos;s less bad , and that the surge@@ on who &apos;s going to be sel@@ ec@@ ted .
now the nice thing this is , if you do this , so far@@ agriculture , create bi@@ , as , on he@@ ct@@ are of land with fif@@ five-@@ thousand people ants in fa@@ vel@@ as , can drive a farmer about a thou@@ sand@@ a-@@ hundred hundred dollars , , wait the the facili@@ ty , , chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and vege@@ tables and fish .
we &apos;re at the th@@ res@@ hold of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really do think that we have go back hundreds , 300 years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time where we &apos;ve fighting , where we &apos;ve gone more le@@ le@@ ed over these things more le@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to more fron@@ ts than now .
if i went to a room full of colleagues and ask for their immedi@@ ate support and king king to tell you what i had had just told you , i would very likely not &apos;t reach the end of the second story before it really un@@ comfortable , , anyone would wea@@ ve jo@@ jo@@ ke , you would change that change the top@@ ic and forget the rest .
so by putting color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness to the ed@@ ges the individual images , photogra@@ phic de@@ fic@@ ings , like ro@@ at , de@@ ju@@ ded colors and dis@@ orders , we &apos;ll get the boundar@@ ies between the different images , and let them look like a single photograph , although a image con@@ tain hundreds of levels .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has considered for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started started nin@@ nin@@ tens of hundreds of thousands , who already started to study in d@@ ce@@ s@@ on , engineering school , technical college , which is called she means , i think , k@@ it .
i had written this piece &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which should push the measu@@ uring ges in visual effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects in whole new new hei@@ ghts , with reali@@ stic human , expres@@ sive characters who were made using c@@ g , and the main fig@@ ures all be . and the world should be c@@ g .
so , the fact is that the 20th century , in 300 years you won &apos;t remember your wars or technical innovation , but rather , than than an era where we &apos;re fac@@ ed and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth are either ac@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted . so the problem is not the change .
i was afraid , not for , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sin@@ k into one of his states , and i could destro@@ y his relationship to his vi@@ o@@ lin when i i started talking about scale der and ar@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of the di@@ d@@ d@@ tic pe@@ tical pe@@ d@@ pe@@ pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ y .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that the car monit@@ or@@ ed in real time has some thousand sensor@@ s , that information of the car , that information to the system , and then you process it and then then can use decisions back to this car and change change things things in real time while information is colle@@ cted .
but my dream here is that if you can make it up econom@@ ically , and at the same time the co2 , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it it@@ ting co2 , i almost wish it almost wanted it to do it , but i &apos;ll probably accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot;
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer s@@ ession , after one of my lec@@ tures , who repor@@ a story . &#91; un@@ clear ... &#93; said he had heard a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music , and at the end of the shot , there was a terrible al@@ ating sound .
you know ? i think giving a na@@ ere person person to think he or she &apos;s like like the ves@@ sel , like bas@@ bas@@ and essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , , creative , un@@ known , infin@@ ite myster@@ y is a little bit too much responsibility to en@@ ship a fra@@ gi@@ le of human che .
and then if you par@@ tly tly at the software we &apos;ve just looked at at it , you will understand why ne@@ nin@@ y-@@ y-@@ percent of our today &apos;s software is not bit intui@@ tive or not on not , the i@@ -@@ pad pad in in many areas or i@@ -@@ phone , although it &apos;s already more intui@@ tive than a classi@@ cal software .
so , in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o on ter@@ o , we did a study with the people at ing -- employees who all worked for for ing -- and these people were all in a gather@@ ction in where they sig@@ sig@@ their their participa@@ tion to their reti@@ re@@ plan .
if i want to get you one of today is that the whole of the data that we consu@@ me is greater than the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking thinking about information over@@ load , i want like you to think about how to use information to information information that give pattern , and we we dete@@ zed so trends that would not have become visible .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine , who was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio -- sort like do@@ bby , the house hol@@ , who came out and and the artist would sort of invisible invisible and make the result of work .
we also have one of these same ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size that it &apos;s there , into the , to actually , the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall of it &apos;s like like like this , in the back , there &apos;s the big battery , and here &apos;s the big battery , here , we &apos;re ones that we simu@@ late the net with .
this idea saved me when the was of of the middle of process of quite eat , pra@@ y , love forces . i fell into one of these dig@@ es of the bt all fall when we all work on something you doesn &apos;t work . you start to think it &apos;s &apos;s a disaster a disaster . this &apos;s the worst book that &apos;s ever written .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &apos; autonom@@ y &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift between the bur@@ den of responsibility for making &apos;s who make who knows -- -- nam@@ ely the doctor .@@ d. -- to somebody who who knows knows and most most probably sick , and that &apos;s not in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision that somebody to make -- nam@@ ely to the patient .
interesting histor@@ ical foot@@ note : when the mo@@ bes came up southern spa@@ in , they brought this practice . and the language changed by class al@@ la@@ h over over the cent@@ u@@ ries , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h h to Ã© ol@@ ol@@ Ã© ol@@ ol@@ Ã© , that you still hear in sti@@ er@@ ers and fl@@ am@@ en@@ co@@ dan@@ ces .
down here in this picture , you see the lab , in leadership o , which is such a respe@@ ned garage , it is such all possible sc@@ frame@@ work that ab@@ ak@@ ted , a group in paris who has a group in has set in , and is quite successful at this , with with , and do pretty interesting things , and i want to do a project a little bit .
i re@@ com@@ men@@ d all of you ste@@ ves book or to look at the film , that not only &apos;t they understand the wonderful connec@@ te@@ dness that created between these two men , but also the music made it connect , and how it finally to the instrument , if this wor@@ n is is allowed to get the mi@@ al@@ f , na@@ than@@ iel away from the street .
and if i trans@@ fer this now , for example , where i jump ori@@ ented as a super@@ vision , sel@@ ec@@ tive as a , in@@ form in the tra@@ p , it comes big to me , i can look look at it in the detail , and yes , trans@@ sa@@ king , i can do it , or or throw it somewhere or buy them somebody , and so on .
the human ability to pt -- this is an interesting story , because people are asking me me how me deal with od@@ ence , , and i &apos;ll to you something : this sentence has never mis@@ for me , and i always felt very un@@ comfortable with answer the questions of people , and i think gradu@@ ally i understand why .
in the early 8@@ 0@@ 0s , i had a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and in@@ fil@@ tra@@ the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength ch of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes and the tox@@ ison was used to en@@ sure z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
the computer visi@@ on algorith@@ ms have held these images to the real space in where these sh@@ ots , which were all all taken near the gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies , you see see elements of stabili@@ zed sli@@ as or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ima@@ process@@ ing , and these things were all considered in related to each other .
b@@ g : now we haven &apos;t set up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting rules of innovation to everything the &quot; nu@@ cle@@ ar &quot; there &apos;s big interest , and the people in the corpo@@ prise were in russi@@ a , india , china china -- i was here and i met the energy and , and talked talked about how would fit to the energy agenda .
no biolog@@ ist , for example , d@@ ts to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just to extin@@ ct , because it &apos;s not not true . and yet -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic har@@ est scen@@ ari@@ um in the terri@@ of bio@@ diversity diversity area -- -- har@@ ely the to to what &apos;s &apos;s optimi@@ stic stic scen@@ ari@@ um is um in the field of cultural diversity .
so we have a situation where , where , as science science continu@@ es , we have to ad@@ mit the more that these categ@@ ories we we thought of be stable of stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that made very simple simple as@@ figu@@ ments ments to create perman@@ ent ent of identi@@ ties , are a lot of fu@@ zz@@ y than we adop@@ ted .
as i &apos;ve been looking models models for models past year to do this , i &apos;ve also arch@@ ing in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sensi@@ able ideas about it than we were how to help crea@@ tively tively deal with the emotional emotional risks associated to creativity .
this , of course , just a simple trick by dr. p@@ . so to do the exercise that i didn want to do , with the the view that rich@@ est five-@@ year-old girls in the middle sing girls in the second stick , but he actually got me to see my daily daily practice hor@@ ror with new eyes with new eyes , and so this became a new so it became a new and intri@@ promis@@ ing experience .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best protein fol@@ der world , this was not a mit professor , not a cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who who was working during as an assi@@ stant of business man@@ working in a re@@ phone in re@@ re@@ clin@@ ic and was the best best protein orange an@@ dn@@ in in the world at night .
this sentence of dealing with ad@@ oles@@ hn@@ ence lives on the idea success success happiness depen@@ ds on it depen@@ having a challenge challenge without being associated ining the experience being associated ined with , and as if my life had gone so successful because i could avoid the potential of a fall fall a life with a s@@ thetic thesis , or or well as people percei@@ ve me with my dis@@ ability .
really , some happy people and companies , for@@ for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ prof@@ its , got the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris ander@@ son is never to leave this back -- buy the nam@@ tional rights on the talk you &apos;re seeing , which has not a ti@@ tle at at that point had had a lot of content , and not there lot many clu@@ es about what the subject was going to be .
so i went home and ate with my wife at night and we told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , there there this technology with that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to raise that temp@@ ace can control a las@@ er so that he can make gra@@ ff@@ iti , that would be brilliant . &quot;
and so there are different , but the nice thing of it is that a ancient molecule has a a million times as much one , say say a co@@ coal molecule , and that &apos;s if you can deal to the problems , and they &apos;s the radiation , foot@@ print and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in their own lea@@ gue .
these people have come online to wealth , they they ac@@ qui@@ red it by using it , for example like , tro@@ j@@ s to ste@@ out of our bank account while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , king or also key@@ log@@ gers , who colle@@ cted our credit card information at the key@@ put on the key@@ board while we &apos;re buying buying an infe@@ cted computer online .
and that would be your answer to the b@@ j@@ Ã¶r@@ l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument if you use all that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals below that er , poverty redu@@ ction , the fighting of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest in money while there are better things we can do .
this made me to another human than my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ t@@ l , who believe that these fore@@ sts are the rise of ar@@ gen@@ site of hu@@ ku@@ k and the cur@@ ven be@@ ak and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ an spi@@ ri@@ ts who live in the north of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts would te in their ha@@ mat@@ sa initi@@ ation .
and they &apos;ve put out down on two two buil@@ ker@@ and and said , o@@ .@@ k , what we make it easier and che@@ aper , and then they &apos;ve got open source , fre@@ ely available available electr@@ electr@@ ics , you know , put this device together this device device , and now they &apos;ve actually shi@@ put this to the market dri@@ ves , and are now the che@@ ap@@ ven@@ d@@ ors of the che@@ ap@@ est ven@@ der ors of these devices around the world .
m@@ s. par@@ ks kept coming back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , where she met two of her ol@@ dest friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ er@@ bus bo@@ bo@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- an incredible afri@@ can@@ -@@ american american -- and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white , whose husband , , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , dr. king re@@ im@@ ed .
and now it &apos;s to biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which comes from syn@@ thetic biology , is that biology is actually a science of information , because , the d.@@ d.@@ .@@ a code is an abstra@@ ct code , it &apos;s not quite the same computers because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , real &apos;s matter , and not just cy@@ ber vers .
a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering off@@ the the per per prize for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wild ste@@ mmer , two scientists who indepen@@ indepen@@ d@@ ently from each other techniques that encoura@@ ge the natural process of working faster and wi@@ des@@ ir@@ able proteins proteins in an efficient efficient way which an an way called fran@@ fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
bru@@ ce brown , a known design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton@@ ton university , has so far to say that this mass media , he says he says the book and the picture , not the tv , the internet and so on , so on what we call as mass media today , that mass media has fossi@@ li@@ zed our memor@@ ies have sha@@ ped our ability to virtu@@ alize .
if one said no , the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ c@@ zi@@ p , which had cr@@ as@@ ed one , and i had dou@@ bled for 10 years , i had hard dou@@ dou@@ bt my great engineering , maybe really a wa@@ away thing , because all my father my father &apos;s colleagues were him were to it , you &apos;ve shu@@ ot@@ out the money out your child .
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which is only because the because the person thinks about it , whether a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ u@@ tic , or some kind of ... in pain@@ ful management , for example , if the patient belie@@ ves enough belie@@ ves a meas@@ ur@@ able impact in the effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
i &apos;d like to show one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we &apos;ve worked again in summer to show you what i think it is is really the pun@@ ch@@ line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th-@@ technology , and this is not necessarily obvious , if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist said before she that it was their greatest fear that that as we move forward towards a ad , gest@@ pe@@ less , gener@@ ic view , we would not only see entire entire band@@ th of human imagination re@@ duced to a nar@@ ged thinking , but that one day we had we wake up from a a dream , and for@@ gotten that there were ever other possibilities .
we cle@@ ed the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bes species , and in , are those two too apart from each other like humans and mi@@ ce , and we gave some extra genes to the we to choose this chromo@@ some , and we cr@@ break it it with enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all the proteins . and it was very amazing when put it into a cell -- and they &apos;ll going to esti@@ mate we ma@@ of our very ma@@ ma@@ ed graph@@ cs here .
it means that a little child from the an@@ de@@ es growing up in the belief that the mountain is an a@@ p@@ -@@ that that that is or deter@@ mine her dest@@ in@@ y will be a very different person , and have a different relationship with this resource or place as a little child from mon@@ tan@@ a who gro@@ up in the belief that a believe that a mountain of a bunch of st@@ cks can be be car@@ car@@ t away .
i had had such en@@ counter recently when i met the extraordinary po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who was now over 90 , but who had long den@@ ser throughout her life , and she told me that when she was up out the the villa@@ virg@@ ini@@ out on the fields , and she said she could feel and hear like a po@@ em about the landscape on her .
usually my role is expla@@ ining to how wonderful wonderful wonderful , the new technologies that have getting up , and i thought , i myself , since i &apos;m under here , i would tell you what i really , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s what &apos;s going on on , with incredible le@@ ap@@ s , which happen happen , which are happen so quickly that we can &apos;t bar@@ ar@@ ely keep t .
and to show the dimension , i looked at all kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , looking for cars , computers , cell phones , flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything . and that &apos;s compared to the amount of electr@@ onic energy that &apos;s using the world world , and i found that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we could produce now , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
a few years ago , the las@@ er prize that scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a gave ded his research in which he took a adult skin fi@@ bro@@ bla@@ sts , and by mani@@ mani@@ pul@@ ating of just four genes that indu@@ duced cell return return to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell is poten@@ tially able to become any cell in your body .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing , take your personal communic@@ communication device i &apos;ll give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can maybe you look at look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos; book book , which is wrong wrong , because nothing in the course of this talk , there &apos;s , will make some sense for you .
this is a re@@ construction of the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral not@@ re lady that occur@@ occur@@ only in the computer images of fli@@ ck@@ r , just put not@@ re lady in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and so on , and so on , each each of these ate c@@ c@@ its represents a picture picture was was known as this model .
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 ago -- the earth , the solar system about four and a half billion years ago -- the first sig@@ ns of , maybe three to four billion billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ tic@@ t@@ t@@ ular organisms organisms , maybe as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species that the human species that shape up formed forming in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of ur@@ gent gent to invest in something that you only have later -- and then the investment is not so clear clear . in fact , in fact i@@ p@@ c report is not necessarily the worst scen@@ ari@@ o , and there are people in the rich world at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , okay , this is not a big dra@@ ma .
i once travel@@ to a young colleagues , 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in west china through sou@@ ast ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a , and only when i came to l@@ has@@ a , , i saw the face behind you hear , -- ,000 6@@ hol@@ red mon@@ u@@ ents that were trans@@ formed into ble and as@@ hes and 1.@@ 2 million people who were mur@@ mur@@ dered by ca@@ ca@@ i@@ ans during the cultural revolution .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the south , we line people -- here &apos;s the risk of con@@ g@@ death , 11 11 times higher than higher the vic@@ ri@@ ti@@ tim is white is white than if it &apos;s black . 22 22 times higher if the char@@ char@@ char@@ is is black and the vic@@ tim white in the same states in whose states in which earth , the ro@@ ru@@ ted yn@@ ter people people the bodies .
so the system is evol@@ ving to make bac@@ ku@@ ps , which make easier to to er@@ mistakes ors which make people inevi@@ t@@ table , and it allows as lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive spaces where where where anyone who obser@@ ves health es the health , can actually disc@@ address things that are the potential mistakes and even re@@ war@@ ded , even re@@ war@@ ded , , and for people people make mistakes who make mistakes should be re@@ war@@ ded for the gra@@ gra@@ of that re@@ war@@ ded .
i even have with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes , the man who cked the psy@@ che@@ re@@ re@@ with the discovery of the ma@@ magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in 3@@ 30 years , discus@@ about it . i said that you couldn &apos;t categ@@ ori@@ ze tr@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine as hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , because the moment you effects impact you &apos;re not there there to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
many of you will know the story , because from ste@@ ves &apos;s article was a book that was med again , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or , , when steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony , who was conver@@ stant , who studied at ju@@ il@@ ar conser@@ vation , and therefore his promis@@ ing career , early early by his par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
now we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their , but but these services are particularly common in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states states like iran , dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign provi@@ d@@ ders like bu@@ mail because you know that they can trust more more than the local provi@@ ders , and that they &apos;re co@@ ded above ss@@ connections connections , so that so that the local government cannot &apos;t ni@@ p around in their conver@@ sa@@ tions .
for example , women as@@ pi@@ ing ing to to vote , the concept of fo@@ unding unding fa@@ thers , which that an@@ atom@@ ic is more important than an@@ atom@@ ic difference , and said said &quot; &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ der@@ is as a difference is significant enough that we shouldn &apos;t have the vot@@ ing , have right right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right property , etc , etc . &quot;
and so i ended up in the people who are interested in space and have to do with nasa and sit sit the nasa nasa ti@@ tions and planning real space mis@@ sions . they go going to russi@@ a to russi@@ russi@@ a before the mission they run through bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l together all , and fly the international space station , take our 3d c@@ amer@@ p@@ me .
in my show , white co@@ at , black art@@ . &quot; i have the it to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would tell every every res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant to the che@@ di@@ di@@ ologists say , &quot; this is my worst mistake mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what &apos;s with her ? &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show with the micro@@ phone phone to him .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound dis@@ ability , and all the ting , all the technology , and the trouble , human performance , if you work on la@@ ke , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other . that &apos;s like in poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers at soldiers who went through something together , and know that they can never explain anyone .
as a computer scientist -- by the way we interaction interaction real real objects -- together with my exper@@ er pat@@ ti and my colleagues je@@ ev@@ ev@@ an ani@@ th@@ i , i began to mi@@ wonder : what if we could use computers that , , instead of a mouse time x who moves like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p on a flat surface -- surface -- what if we could take with both hands and take data physi@@ cally understand data physi@@ cally organi@@ ze it in a way that we want it ?
so , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ize my my talk in the sense that the characteri@@ stics the skills skills the the that that &apos;ve &apos;ve red from the age , and that &apos;ve been a a little bit little bit ck in the machine age that can can be activ@@ activ@@ ated with the help of the cy@@ ber age , and that we have way , in this way of complex , new products , not actually coming back into the future , but actually , coming back to our roots .
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths are separ@@ ated from three and four years from their families , and in a sha@@ dow world of fin@@ li@@ se se , in ck hu@@ tt@@ off off the gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years , two peri@@ ods of times of year nine , , are cho@@ cted to ele@@ ct the nine nine months of preg@@ nan@@ nan@@ cy to spent they them in the la@@ p of their conduc@@ tive mother , they now spend me@@ they or@@ me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ ically in the great mother .
at this point , ja@@ four has told oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens if we take an rel@@ sett@@ ate surface of our country -- what what if we just give it -- a message -- a part of the american bas@@ part of the can@@ adi@@ an , -- and if people to work under the can@@ adi@@ an an or the the rules or the united states , can they work there , and on the surface of these mes@@ sages that they can go to , they normally have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
if somebody has taken eff@@ or@@ ts and and char@@ ged all these sac@@ red and share who they they are all then then a picture of the not@@ re women ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly suddenly rich@@ ed with all this data , and i can use them as a starting point to di@@ ve into this room , into these meta@@ ses who use photos of other people , and so doing a kind of ex@@ sive social experience with using other provi@@ ders .
i want to end with a po@@ em cap@@ by by an per@@ si@@ an po@@ called fi@@ fi@@ the 14@@ th century , which my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is dem@@ bo@@ is , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god , who knows knows four words . &quot; every child knows god , the god , not the god of the bo@@ bo@@ ments , but the god god who knows only god , and he repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats doing words , he always say , come , dance with me . &quot;
a huge story , but of course , we have the problem of a growing growing company , and we we have two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ six , a small group , we decided that we go small and start back and with the next theme of the the future , and and that means and our behavior , it &apos;s it &apos;s back to again , which starts crazy again that people say what &apos;s the ru@@ at@@ h , that &apos;s all that &apos;s all , we &apos;re talking about memory .
it won &apos;t a lot of room for it in malaria squ@@ h@@ south of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but still , through time and ritual , formed a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ bus on earth , which is not based on the idea of not to to to it , but on a much more sub@@ tle intuition , the idea that earth earth can exist exist because it only only because because it &apos;s brea@@ th@@ ed into the human consciousness .
from the medical point of view view you you can say that my legs , the las@@ er surgery for vision im@@ ability , k@@ k@@ plac@@ int of ti@@ tan artificial hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ts for aging body that allow people to really use of their possibilities and to set themselves across the boundar@@ ies that have their natural dest@@ te their natural dest@@ in@@ y to develop not to speak of social net plat@@ forms , allow able own identity to define themselves own identity to define themselves themselves a a way way and ori@@ ent worldwide over groups that they can find themselves .
