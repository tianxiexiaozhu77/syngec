but it goes .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
we love entertain@@ ment .

thank you .
that &apos;s it .
wonderful , ne ?
she did .
they &apos;re all important .
in@@ efficient .
efficiency .
not very sustainable .
essential .
very different term .
so meet al .
exciting .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
what did they do ?
ban is blan@@ k .
i was ama@@ zed .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
pretty good , right ?
a couple more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he op@@ ens the door .
so they knew everything .
1,000 , very good .
good work .
that &apos;s terri@@ bly important .
the farm is incredible .
that was fascinating .
this is go .
what do you say ?
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
what happened ?
thank you .
sounds familiar , what ?
why stop live longer ?
they have similar principles .
oh , this .
hey , why not ?
that &apos;s our present .
that &apos;s the system .
you could see manhattan .
this was the result .
there is no normal .
centers were built .
just do your job .
all interests me .
what happened ?
len@@ to slowly .
good day .
good day .
and that matters .
can i be honest ?
what ?
it has sensor@@ s .
we can do .
what was the result ?
here &apos;s the video .
yes , milli@@ seconds .
what ?
again .
very good .
the environmental discussion .
these people make money .
i know .
i don &apos;t know .
they use their hands .
why do we do ?
flying c@@ at .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
it is not a country .
that &apos;s a wish .
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
i don &apos;t think .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;ve got a question .
how do we know ?
and i was an artist .
what ?
yes , it can .
we can do it differently .
so how does it work ?
let &apos;s call it .
how care ?
what do these people need ?
can we change it ?
those days are over .
b@@ g : thanks .
management .
this is the last one .
you can walk inside .
so it &apos;s true .
so where are we going ?
that would have been okay .
i thought about it .
what is media ?
so let &apos;s see .
here &apos;s an example .
so they do this .
you . &quot;
i was facing him .
players are not around .
and i kept working .
okay . thank you .
this is what happens to us today .
so she was back .
oh . a moment .
what do you want to do ?
let me tell you .
bom@@ bs .
thank you .
we need energy .
why does this happening ?
i go here .
there are two choices .
but i kept working .
not tox@@ ic in it .
you see it immediately .
why should we do that ?
he &apos;s not going to do that .
it feels great .
wonder .
thanks for listening .
they actually hur@@ hurt .
i swe@@ ar it .
i represent kids .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
writer .
it &apos;s against justice .
j@@ k : both .
first , just stop .
maybe 10 times many .
be a ment@@ or .
make the camera .
my gut feeling again .
but the wrong things .
thank you very much .
just a trip .
yeah . all right .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
here you see it now .
challenge .
the data came in .
what creates illusion ?
and it did .
i created one .
here &apos;s another example .
but it didn &apos;t .
no food .
people were crazy .
but it gets worse .
keep you fresh .
loved loved .
does anybody see something ?
my grand@@ father .
good after@@ noon , all together .
and then it got international .
let me sum up .
there &apos;s an old study .
online crimin@@ als .
he always showed here .
that &apos;s a great question .
some came and left .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
here &apos;s the city .
in china , it was different .
here &apos;s another example .
i dis@@ agree .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
fortunately not , right ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and then it happened again .
it &apos;s not our problem .
that &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s not struggle .
i will never forget it .
is it photograph@@ y at all ?
okay , some .
i mean the sou@@ l .
but there is something else .
really cool . &quot;
very expensive real e@@ state .
yes it is .
the answer is no .
and it got better .
just on . lots of fun .
crisis . death . disaster .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h .
she did quie@@ tly .
we have lost the contact .
it would be in@@ toler@@ able .
he had experience .
and why is that ?
compar@@ ison .
almost iden@@ tical structure .
and i always had it .
give pe@@ e a chance .
we have three main groups .
i felt good .
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
did you see these guys ?
i really don &apos;t .
what does everything have to be done ?
they were still fish .
and a lot of people forget about this .
it has billions .
am i going to like the color ?
my name is am@@ it .
priv@@ acy needs to be given .
o@@ oh , thank you .
is that what your opini@@ on ?
who will make it ?
called paul off@@ it .
they look like this .
don &apos;t be dis@@ coura@@ ged .
this is short .
the work of interpre@@ ting .
this is emotions .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
but where are we useful ?
so what does that mean ?
let &apos;s call it don .
they had no mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we work ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened after wards ?
i grew up in india .
do your fish ?
and fortunately he died .
game is 2007 .
i had a good life .
keep us healthy .
i don &apos;t like that question .
what do you believe now ?
that &apos;s basically .
and i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
what does that mean ?
is about light ?
... his own story .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
first we have population .
water comes coming .
who are those rela@@ tives ?
i want to ask you something .
we need to spread .
you see that down there .
you have to understand that .
why don &apos;t think about it that way ?
what am i looking at ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
his name is .
but what do we do ?
is it going to have my size ?
that &apos;s about it .
we always always pel .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
most here know .
actually , i made two mistakes .
and this is a map for open .
it would out .
so what do we have to do ?
fe@@ li@@ x .
from conflict creates creativity .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or may it be possible ?
he &apos;s that guy on the left .
we &apos;re too many .
maybe that is the reality .
we were 20 people .
it sounds bad .
they cannot have bone .
i &apos;m going to end .
this &apos;s what the ch@@ art looked like .
what else can we do ?
very sc@@ ary .
they called me .
: due technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are in come .
what &apos;s the sou@@ l sou@@ l ?
i say everything .
we &apos;re not going to making ourselves .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
that &apos;s the exciting .
but key is ...
so what about fit@@ ness ?
so it works .
and they set them .
and this is not nothing at all .
what actually happened ?
one place is south korea .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
they really loved it .
the same thing , just bigger .
i was next .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so who is normal ?
here you have it again .
so &apos;s what ha@@ cking now ?
and finally , epi@@ c meaning .
this picture is from this place .
that was the beginning of the journey .
first exten@@ sion , second .
you want to feed the world ?
they connected these two people .
my wife told me .
but it was very sad .
what is this ?
they could have done better .
is the cru@@ x .
but they do it .
this is very ris@@ ky .
does it curious ?
how did that feel ?
and that worked very well .
because you can train that .
the answer is yes .
i wanted to support them .
sometimes i &apos;m pus@@ ge too much .
and then everybody went down .
taking a@@ we .
her mother left her alone .
like , you know .
who is successful ?
tell me about this world .
i see this record .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
that &apos;s such a natural thing .
thank you for your attention .
this christ@@ mas .
okay , so there &apos;s a couple .
they saw the big impact .
and it took 18 months .
think about decisions .
so it &apos;s circle .
i just loved two .
she shares her experiences with others .
well , we will .
can &apos;t be no problem .
i might not say that .
the answer is no .
it was a huge success .
he yes , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
is rational ?
the data was available before .
how many people would choose creativity ?
pattern recogni@@ tion should work .
it was my first fire .
and there are hundreds of them .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
you can have it .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
the power plant can explo@@ de .
they &apos;re all important . &quot;
that made me really sad .
they always say why ?
what happened that day ?
everybody &apos;s is talking about lu@@ today .
people were still happy .
so let me remember .
they come from artists .
she was back and dying .
now , how could this happen ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
but it &apos;s &apos;t fast .
that is a game out outside .
i learned everything .
anyone know what this is ?
and again , he poin@@ ted him h@@ am .
for example , this perception in context .
so that &apos;s good news .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
talk about water wars .
she did for three years .
it &apos;s completely different .
it just wasn &apos;t invented invented yet .
sometimes perspective is illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so they saw something magic .
play isn not sil@@ ly sil@@ ly .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
actually , he colle@@ cted fish .
no has never been an opportunity .
so , we can .
how are we going to help you ? &quot;
is all education ?
they changed the story .
and good news .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
it &apos;s not finished .
but there are two problems .
and it was an incredible experience .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
no one has ever said that before .
the whole building was made of water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today 2.@@ 3 million .
what would our te@@ stim@@ ment look like ?
but , but you know what ?
they can play with different ways .
they create an epi@@ c story .
everyone needs gold glass .
in basically , they &apos;re doing the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other br@@ ands are like this ?
the white lines are population .
game doesn &apos;t just child games .
and we did that .
and he actually says that he way .
and then something weird happened .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible writing .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
i talk a lot about these questions .
that was great .
the data is always showing this .
and we take it up .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
take nothing for gran@@ ted .
and this was 19 years ago .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
be kog@@ . &quot;
it &apos;s it , very simple .
so paul is a terror@@ ist .
which would you love the most ?
now the waste is now .
it doesn &apos;t have this sou@@ l .
i &apos;ll &apos;t co@@ ok with that .
the morning , before of play .
i started feeling better .
au@@ ti@@ stic student .
this is one of the images .
we went into area .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation again .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
it doesn &apos;t do technologi@@ cally .
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
this is about five meters long .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
and then realize it .
and other shouldn &apos;t suff@@ er .
and already you already got a problem .
somehow the kids aren &apos;t anymore .
so the question is how ?
what lessons did we learn ?
we we alive .
she beat another 25@@ 7 .
they &apos;re out@@ door computers .
anybody mas@@ here ?
waste is waste .
and we &apos;re very happy .
we all love baseball , right ?
and we &apos;re too many .
it has the biggest impact .
my second mistake was worse .
so i made the movie .
and the form has a role .
slowly , sur@@ ely , it did .
they cannot store energy .
and then i can trans@@ mit the whole .
it &apos;s go , we don &apos;t go .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
okay , that &apos;s really coura@@ ge .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all meta@@ data .
and it starts with a doctor .
you gets you and similar .
i &apos;m going to stand ess to you .
because i can say everything .
even our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
asked the nur@@ se box .
creativity had to somehow get out .
today , everything is easy .
that sounds sc@@ ting .
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
i really wanted to be normal then .
i got a little sc@@ ared of technology .
so i went to the court .
once the ju@@ dge saw me .
we can &apos;t do it easy .
so that &apos;s what to show you .
this is sc@@ ary .
another exciting phenomenon .
next : nuclear .
let ahead with us .
but really effective , yes ?
that &apos;s totally tri@@ tri@@ al .
thank you for pati@@ ence .
what else ris@@ ky ?
so i tried something exciting .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
just be who you are .
her family got together .
i remember my first fire .
but we need that .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , right ?
what is a story ?
and his answer was yes .
the movement to writing it .
i sho@@ a bit through my head .
so look what happens .
not , navi@@ gate .
why did i go to medicine ?
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
all adults were conscious of risks .
have you been c@@ vy ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
so the cor@@ relation is low .
the truth is more like this .
the game begins -- sil@@ ence .
do you want je@@ ans with holes ?
this is like speaking learning .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
so i just started playing .
that &apos;s nothing to do out of nothing .
it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
and this video is in real time .
i like things different .
and that &apos;s at the beginning .
so &apos;s really changed the dynamic .
i went to ja@@ il -- difficult .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ ate .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
because for me , it means remin@@ memory .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s rapi@@ dly spre@@ ing its rapi@@ dly .
how and what did he experience ?
it can know where we are .
this is a child game , right ?
we &apos;re in germany sustain@@ ability .
and you know what i learned ?
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
this is a picture of the object .
you know what is ?
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
you see something fun here .
know what three seconds ?
that &apos;s got to be the difference of age .
i don &apos;t take the same way .
you can show , i was there .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
i find them .
do we really want to go in that direction ?
they had been gene@@ tically expres@@ ated .
music is medicine . music changes us .
he can only use his eyes .
these are going to be ir@@ sti@@ sting .
i could draw . i could paint .
so the first step to interpretation .
something fell into me .
oh , time time ?
baseball is full great statistics .
this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
priv@@ acy is debate .
because we live on a water planet .
there is another reason .
i really like nice clo@@ thing .
and there &apos;s a couple of reasons for this .
le@@ go made it possible for everybody .
we started this 15 years ago .
we can gain our nutri@@ ents .
in pres@@ tion of perhaps two percent .
and yet , it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
it turns out to be really difficult .
how far do you get ?
and these are the neu@@ ral structure .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
anyway , we need a solution .
when you come to that , right ?
you can do this all the time .
they are an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
so we measu@@ red its movement .
and that can make a big difference .
but the truth is far away .
it seemed it was quite popular .
in the book and the picture .
sun@@ light and co2 are a method .
i stop stop , thank you .
because this is the minim@@ um .
this has nothing to do with science .
they fle@@ ded the chan@@ n@@ els .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
but perhaps , that &apos;s not the case .
five million people are using it every month .
but it requires a lot of planning .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a .
we get get this positive feedback .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a di@@ me .
now we do this with air@@ planes .
okay , you really want to know this ?
now gre@@ g le@@ mond .
i fell in love with this fish .
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been too simple .
how do i get you ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to prove this to you .
here the sun comes up .
who would ever wish one ?
and i jump there every morning .
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er kids ?
he was over six .
that was more em@@ ph@@ as@@ zation .
this is a very sensitive question .
was a pretty tough project .
this &apos;s the ta@@ age .
and this sounds very different than before .
we &apos;ve got something that doesn &apos;t go up .
but they really want to deep .
and the goal is very simple .
architec@@ ts and engineers fortunately .
we &apos;ve got to increase increase complexity complexity .
and i had to go .
here &apos;s her date .
her father died shor@@ after were born .
i started my usual talk .
you want to get ent in the museum ?
so , this crazy story could be true .
we won some a@@ wards .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
i slide my sle@@ ve back .
and what does this mean for designers ?
it &apos;s to add the experience .
these ri@@ vers are taking very rapi@@ dly .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
i learned from my grandmother .
no , no , you can &apos;t .
there &apos;s a billion people to to star@@ ine today .
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
the st@@ ones are co@@ ded .
we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
do it for kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s changing change standards .
a has these benefits and risks .
we need to think about what br@@ ands .
my brother star@@ ed .
who do you want to form ?
we can rein@@ vent everything .
b@@ j@@ Ã¶r@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
that simply , it will happen .
&quot; risk &quot; isn &apos;t a easy game .
and it got me up like this .
they even bring fund@@ ing .
often in the third will to forget .
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil .
it de@@ als about in@@ ck@@ ity .
i call that the bright tiger .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
who could have predi@@ it up ?
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
oh my god . oh my god .
we &apos;ve done a lot of process process .
we &apos;re been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
and this is depen@@ ched to phosp@@ hor@@ us .
ide@@ ology , not science .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i started an institute .
so nature are made .
this might be trans@@ formed in public .
we actually re@@ defined poverty .
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we don &apos;t like talking about our history .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
for longer than these two networks .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
i talked a lot about magic .
they are today project ri@@ ams .
the movie was not yet ex@@ ted yet .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
auto@@ matically , he goes to the right thought .
in way we think being north .
they gave their blood pressure .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty no@@ is@@ y .
the result of this was a cat@@ astrop@@ ha@@ e .
happy produ@@ tivity . fantastic !
thank you , but the best is still coming .
and everyone in this room has to go .
we &apos;ve ved a kind of equ@@ bri@@ um .
and no one seems to emer@@ ge about that .
in people over ur@@ ine .
the living comm@@ rise to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
if you haven &apos;t heard .
in which words would you describe ban ?
the other one was di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i don &apos;t know who sees .
there &apos;s also world recor@@ as well .
asking , what &apos;s the right ?
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they &apos;re very well .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations only a few milli@@ seconds .
for energy , i fell here .
and here you feel it here .
the students are divi@@ ded gra@@ des .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
say what you feel .
totally to some goal .
he died , broken through the history .
the question is , what &apos;s now ?
he &apos;s interested in fire ligh@@ making .
there he wrote .
here &apos;s this little mechan@@ ism .
let &apos;s make a little little medi@@ foot@@ print .
this &apos;s how the building works .
you lose rare animals .
they were dri@@ ll@@ ing each each other .
she will deeply .
they kept us from being inspired .
i represent people in death cells .
i hope you for@@ give me .
i wrote these crazy things .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
let &apos;s start by that .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
so there are two cy@@ cles .
we put unique elements here .
this this sounds sounds strange for first .
so this &apos;s a hard nu@@ t .
and ... so , doesn &apos;t mean that optimi@@ stic .
first of all , if he has died .
it &apos;s been increasing .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
so scot@@ t gets this fru@@ fru@@ .
poli@@ , all all au@@ ded .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
so i followed my gut feeling .
they literally literally moved the le@@ ver .
maybe some mu@@ tations .
cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
wi@@ ver@@ ties just bel@@ ong to our lives .
what do you think happens next ?
we worked late until night night late .
they have . they always do .
the by@@ product is clean water .
he moved back to sil@@ ence .
he turns off the power .
it might take to be invited .
i read you the post .
that &apos;s j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel um .
so , from the modern to computer society .
and curi@@ osity doesn &apos;t learn .
we talk talk about that .
we go through initi@@ ritu@@ als .
it &apos;s about a re@@ services of america .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
mechan@@ ism comes from lies .
the main man turned me .
d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ , exactly .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
that &apos;s not usually the rou@@ tes .
they &apos;re all questions .
look at what she does .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
it &apos;s a little less destruction .
that &apos;s what they do .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that .
but with the right design , here we go .
how would you describe your brand ?
we can support them to be good .
something very strange happens here .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
what will those three billion people ?
we also get very rate data .
it was really extremely profound .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
this is the system we live in .
we can support them to be good .
and women were argu@@ ed this success@@ fully .
and she &apos;s a very ris@@ ky , well .
you should give you which wish .
even cat@@ s look at this video .
the roof was covered with water as well .
this is a painting of a circle .
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
that is also such a paradig@@ m shift .
but i continu@@ ed to ask these questions .
she was ined .
you &apos;re from from back to the first time .
i never met him personally .
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .

we b@@ old , fresh .
he sha@@ ok his head , no .
i believed anyone .
but today we beyond beyond .
they ta@@ their internet connection .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
this will be it next apri@@ l .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are mobile phones in the future .
you are the home countries from somebody .
what takes another five milli@@ seconds ?
i &apos;m looking at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ an .
so this is the reason for this project .
temp@@ t is paraly@@ zed today .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
this is an environmental network .
anybody does anyone know what this is ?
if that doesn &apos;t work ?
and i &apos;d like to read you .
and there are employees .
make it possible -- all of you here .
what &apos;s just repres@@ ented .
so it creates a back@@ feedback .
we &apos;ll come back to these people .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
and why ? gene@@ tically trans@@ formed food .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ue is open source .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t on rela@@ tions . &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
no , no , far missing .
the che@@ f had ked it .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let her . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s such a common part .
the bank is from a different place .
we have meas@@ in this country .
they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
i was living in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
and that was the out@@ break .
so , the first exciting pri@@ mate .
somebody made an ol@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ oned version of it .
maybe i did it some reason .
not even the truth it will free free .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
also , those sources sources are inter@@ rup@@ tions .
we need to see out this .
conditions of these things don &apos;t exist .
we can give to ourselves .
15@@ 6 nations send our tv chan@@ nel .
p@@ ale blue do@@ t .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center center .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks .
do@@ s@@ too has a role .
everyone would like to make people happ@@ ier .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
alone saying , what &apos;s information ?
tell me a little bit about that bit .
i learned some very simple things .
you put it box box .
it can know how we hold it .
she exp@@ to to five in@@ ches .
it &apos;s called &quot; vote with me . &quot;
there was never a time like this before .
this is a hum@@ ble little ap@@ p .
there is another aspe@@ ct about the story .
because we don &apos;t want to make a genes around ?
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s the bacteria .
dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
his personal impres@@ sions of the se@@ ro@@ chs .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
because now , they can use a set of three sentence .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
now who &apos;s ready for this journey .
a lot of my cli@@ cli@@ ers are very young .
the guy in the middle not so much .
particularly beautiful story , i mean .
eat whole ch@@ h cool whi@@ p .
and then he can run off .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
and he got to process that as the present .
i &apos;ll try that through an example .
you see up the ti@@ mel@@ ine .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ les .
the goal of the film is transpar@@ ency .
there are some to come together .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
what you need is a new medical culture .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we get an absolutely flat line .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
what does this look like here ? pretty good .
alone , dama@@ med and without support .
evil ? i was conf@@ used .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
it was a grou@@ per .
my cou@@ s@@ ins running around .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al water flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
they run the process they get it .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate ate directly to the artist .
we don &apos;t want companies to own see@@ ds .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
the next step happened within those communities .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
as an artist i care about connection .
he had 20 minutes ma@@ atory music .
sha@@ y the environment , make less waste .
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
a language is expression of the human mind .
ordinary people are not devices . &quot;
let &apos;s pull up something else .
i &apos;m getting ti@@ red , like all of us .
but the game is a sha@@ pe@@ trans@@ duc@@ er .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
sleep is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ous .
it should be tain those elements again .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything but disco@@ discover .
thank you . i have a question for you .
this is ro@@ ber@@ to tan@@ cing .
but i &apos;ll talk about that in a minute .
but western governments also help themselves .
and green , it was a disaster .
that really sol@@ ves the fuel problem .
this is my super@@ market . no big .
it just happened , you know ?
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural videos .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
thank you , that was incredible .
this is one , part of her .
the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
by the way way , this is just the labor ti@@ el .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what are i appe@@ aling for ?
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
isn &apos;t spend or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
so what are we going to end from all of this ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
so virtu@@ ally a trans@@ lation .
and further , now they always see it .
so far , this was a problem for super@@ computers .
the emergen@@ cy person@@ nel just all all the str@@ ands .
there are lots of great books on that top@@ ic .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can dis@@ range .
in two hours , it buil@@ ds everywhere .
mean@@ now , the instru@@ ments have evol@@ ed .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a li@@ p pen .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum museum .
and in this three ##AT##-##AT## @@ angle there are three sent@@ ences .
you know three sentence from school .
i want to explain that a little minute .
actually , didn &apos;t want to make vi@@ ral video .
do you remember the win@@ l again ?
mon@@ day : color is something powerful .
and then it looks like this .
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficient .
my mother called me a few minutes .
it makes making we &apos;re up there .
it &apos;s the average power of the bat .
so , let me give me a little bit of that .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
if they burn coal , no .
water amo@@ unts have increas@@ ed .
we asked around , and nobody knew .
it kind of wired up .
you know that science is not a company .
and the list can continue less@@ ly .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
say , there are no predic@@ ers .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
second hal@@ f ##AT##-##AT## @@ time . end of the normal time .
everybody just ate eating pi@@ ke .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so are are actually arch@@ a@@ ic models ?
this is something built in the city .
so , that was my primary motivation .
&quot; sustainable proteins . &quot; he said .
let me show you how they work .
you can zo@@ om out very easily .
maybe we can think of ver@@ ver@@ ties as change .
it &apos;s not much better .
imagine that for a moment .
you just have to spread it as possible .
we think about energy today .
it is a game called fol@@ dit .
so , that really ble@@ w me out .
can you play them in blue now ?
people were suffering ered . people were fighting ought .
imagine a airplane smo@@ ke .
so it says nor@@ nor@@ ms more .
no , we notice what &apos;s inside .
raise your hands . let me see .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
i &apos;m not where we go .
you walk around and you am@@ use yourself .
american america . find out out .
i &apos;ll call them &quot; next billion . &quot;
and there is a central point about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but it &apos;s got an un@@ expected turn .
sh@@ ter the environment , consu@@ mes less energy .
you should tell me about my brand .
third , es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now you see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ an .
my fourth technology : pres@@ mption for complexity .
i thought i could integra@@ te .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
i work in the solar technology industry .
i wanted to re@@ store health after one disease .
now if you go a piece of here .
my parents are the 80 on the he@@ ams .
this is machine machine gen@@ gen@@ a .
and let me show you a very simple example .
if not , somebody bits today .
we still think they &apos;re origin@@ mal .
you just listen and then start talking .
and the two last ones are here today .
and , you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
but the reality is always un@@ predic@@ table .
life hadn not changed for cent@@ ries .
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s a chance to do something .
my grandmother has me for@@ gotten his life .
offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
don@@ ur@@ day : self ##AT##-##AT## @@ confidence is the key .
we talk dro@@ dro@@ ning ning information .
i tried to keep the body .
we beat it . pu@@ ff .
it me@@ ms a thousand square kilometers .
you come in two ways of it -- very simple .
now i walked into the court .
i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;
because that &apos;s very evidence , right ?
they laugh@@ ed more than they doing here .
you can immer@@ ve in a particular year .
we &apos;re gene@@ tically alter@@ formed food .
the three words were : remember ?
it are in the back of our body .
what ? it got me out .
and there is the problem of bur@@ ing problem .
it was something we knew to do .
this is called the o@@ sive model .
but so many got help over the years .
third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
the new chromo@@ some went to the cell .
we are in the middle of this transition point .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
their problem is they have too little .
now i add a b@@ ass .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
i didn &apos;t dis@@ agree of that .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality happens in a lot of different forms .
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population .
nobody needs to give your ideas to green light .
the perman@@ ering ice is mar@@ ked with red .
i think i may have heard more hands .
so that &apos;s what the super@@ market is .
scot@@ t was talking from man to man .
it &apos;s all that is useful .
our goal was to say , okay .
seriously , i i@@ tell the do@@ it !
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
we got out what didn &apos;t work .
they go go ; save the shoes .
we &apos;re always creating new ten@@ sions and conflict .
what do you do cer@@ ti@@ ti@@ ates ?
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go a slide again .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
yet , we seem to be satis@@ fied .
and if you &apos;t , still dance dance dan@@ dance .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
it &apos;s like a po@@ ta@@ to .
anyway , they do that in it .
so that made sense , it fit fit .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and this is one million company .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
then he wh@@ is@@ ed into the ear .
mot@@ ors , driven -- four possibilities .
and this is very important in medical research .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you !
this would be somebody who is completely intui@@ tive .
so again , it worked really well .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
after then , it &apos;s the combin@@ ation of the different images .
there can be a order of change .
we need to set ourselves for more research fun@@ ing .
and here every piece is very well .
so at this we need digital security systems .
what would you say to someone who thinks this ?
let me show you from here .
ama@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
this has to go down here , to zero .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
and in time , you can re@@ to different again .
embar@@ ras@@ ame .
is it about the details or the colors ?
you can &apos;t put them all around .
all of it is comp@@ pos@@ able of it .
the internet and a mira@@ cle .
here are some on the ham@@ p@@ ton .
what we want is to create the future .
that will bal@@ an@@ ed in china in a second .
my grand@@ parents ur@@ ged this number to 70 .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
now this carto@@ on makes a few .
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
they &apos;ve all back back on their way .
pic@@ as@@ so says , they just wait .
so two pa@@ irs , each is a baby .
and we keep our expec@@ tations along .
and i went back to work .
now , i would take out the need@@ le .
that the ec@@ ology is a global .
the story@@ telling takes more and more senses .
it only only the test of survival and success .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ entation .
now i &apos;m going to do some dru@@ ms about this .
i was totally excited , you know .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
that becomes a key of this stuff .
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and security .
none haven &apos;t done it in the world .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
starting next week , that &apos;s to the market .
natural light off@@ des a smart grid .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
it &apos;s the way i like to be .
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
at tially , we only sig@@ ned .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that things was changed .
they live with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
so i think we must be leaders .
ladies and gentle@@ men , relationships .
i wonder : how could that happen ?
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
and we had to take them , which we did .
the question is why people accept that .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
there &apos;s all foot@@ foot@@ print .
and every night , they fly 40 miles back .
first i thought that was a game .
so we have this incredibly simpli@@ stic idea .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
it has a kno@@ on , on / on .
well , it was fri@@ day , and that &apos;s true .
let &apos;s pre@@ like having a machine here .
these things have a positive effect .
somebody sitting with had no childhood back there .
what about food ? &quot;
on the left side , you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the rest of time , they &apos;re del@@ del@@ alized .
none of them wanted to do with the movie .
and try it again with another generation .
thank you very much for invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
they fly 26 miles to farm every morning .
and they &apos;re not going to die of mas@@ ks .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
that our input to the system is vote .
and of course , it made click .
and i have to say , it gave me strength .
at 16 , i started illu@@ strate books .
i start with some simple examples .
the best is is -- in a second .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask important questions .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
i want to show you something too first here .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
i never want to move a life more .
do you know how to call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
it suppor@@ ts others talk about their fail@@ mistakes .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
what happened that we could .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . went on .
why do we do this ? why do it ?
there had to be another puzz@@ le piece .
that &apos;s how they -- this way your fing@@ ers walk .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , right ?
i put them and went to treatment .
and that argument makes no sense .
it was summer , and i had shor@@ ts .
they don &apos;t invest time in power of power .
notice two things on this cur@@ ve .
so , the theme of the day : financial conser@@ saving .
and we want to make this material available available for everybody .
and i say that &apos;s good .
we want to do something about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
in my work i learned simple things .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
so smart grid , a huge subject everywhere .
the last three of the five i i sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed .
so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
in fact , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
instead , let &apos;s look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
and we need to make a better about this device .
it was about four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what i say is very important .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , be@@ ds a reali@@ stic level .
and everything is wra@@ aging or content .
there are some very interesting things .
so not saving , avoid , avoid .
it was going to roll land across you .
it &apos;s going to be challenge to offer that for 9 .
he came to me and hu@@ hu@@ ged me .
i &apos;m really sorry . is it go crazy ?
all of those were there started to divi@@ de .
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation .
and i &apos;m going to sum@@ mar@@ ize that short for you .
it was a lot of , and i in hur@@ ry .
technical cy@@ cy@@ it in the same thing .
anyway anyway . that &apos;s what i want .
now , one out of this pattern is trying to see something .
we don &apos;t get identity , we inv@@ ent them .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to man .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
at the beginning the tri@@ b@@ al society is through language .
i particularly took it out here .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they &apos;ve rever@@ sed the flow of the water .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
and in that head , memory was itself .
and what does it actually in there ?
and i found extremely exciting .
we understood the weather is global .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news clearly .
so we can &apos;t capture these things .
it has molecular balance over 300 million .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern of development .
i have something i want to show you .
in the countries where people are fund@@ money .
so i think this &apos;s my brand .
store it , sol@@ ase the rest .
how about living in good health longer ?
did you all taken your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
no apple ever ha@@ sted that again .
writing the dna was an interesting step .
so that was a highly strange experience .
to give my upp@@ f feedback .
all these di@@ mil@@ l are around everywhere .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands have done .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
we want to reduce the number of pris@@ on@@ ers .
i want to help you cal@@ m .
all right , what brand ger@@ ry ?
because we doesn &apos;t feel real money .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ go mel@@ ons .
so for him they were just building blocks .
one , i thought he had ni@@ ney bri@@ ones .
i was not familiar with the lab@@ els .
we have 20 percent in germany .
and we saw this in mobile phones .
the sil@@ ence is ear .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
the head@@ quar@@ ters is right here .
i wear je@@ ans , almost the time .
as i said , am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ gs .
they are vi@@ vable , both together .
but maybe you can also agree them .
i remember it was yesterday .
all of that sum@@ i@@ ed , mistakes are inevi@@ table .
so you don &apos;t lose animals come animals often .
this is an investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we have access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology .
so you can understand the whole movement .
they get less er because we catch them .
there seems to be dis@@ dis@@ ement .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
and we see that it works out catch this .
we did it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
in fact , coal is not dir@@ ty .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
that &apos;s something like our c@@ ghts .
that means we have to get phosp@@ hor@@ back .
and i becomes a character in the book .
so i think bas@@ ics are very simple .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
but our problem would even even bigger .
i think first of that is the curi@@ osity .
i &apos;ve my job at 95 l@@ pounds .
they wear on the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so each dro@@ let was a slightly different .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
the answer is probably likely to be no .
do you know how many people are looking at these ted@@ talks ?
it &apos;s is supposed to be com@@ pos@@ able .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like that .
here are the results we just got .
there are those that are more tial .
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
we found that it moves really weird .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
yeah , so , what should be bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
good night , swe@@ et th@@ th@@ ac@@ s . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his mind .
interpretation interpretation har@@ ely talked about early education .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
and that worked . scot@@ t &apos;s appl@@ ause .
and all all leads us to a big question .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
today i talk to you about energy and climate .
she had the last word in every family argument .
the transi@@ transition happens . we can feel it all .
and in my ju@@ oles@@ cents , i said , expec@@ tation .
how could we possible to do this ?
so if you gener@@ alize it , then what happens .
it &apos;s about a behavior po@@ op print .
and that was not hard diagno@@ sis .
i was a obs@@ essi@@ essi@@ student .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he just fa@@ ke you and not yourself .
it &apos;s not how one person lives .
... that do@@ do@@ ses is role .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and finally , we should wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
it &apos;s really old and it &apos;s done .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
well , i understand that . i do .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
i learned that , in a moment , everything all different .
this is foot@@ age over a du@@ ration of six seconds .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and that is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
or they didn &apos;t have any phot@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
well , really good , maybe maybe a all star .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
and we use this word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
now a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
it &apos;s really very important to get there .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
because we can &apos;t live without life lies .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
and that was an experience in hum@@ ty for me .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affect the result .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
these sil@@ ly films don &apos;t bring us money .
but drop &apos;s not always a bad thing .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
i i , many of you here , in room room probably know this trick .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
why do i have to afford these little car ?
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ or .
i want to tell you about how we figured that out .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means mental health .
to make a phr@@ ase with its own breath .
or are you more like a down@@ at@@ tribu@@ te ?
i can change the sequence while you run running .
and they also feel their mov@@ ements and their pen@@ cy .
i made the decision to the united states .
if your job is dance that , dance .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ net .
the whole is a game , i have to say .
so we all got 1.@@ 5 billion players .
thank for for at ted . thank you .
so it went of my two passi@@ ons .
yeah , what are of projects do we do like this ?
she &apos;d bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was run in blue .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
8@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
i had a relationship with that beauty over several months .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just nat@@ ance .
the bird age to the machine age .
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
but are we going to make the best of our game drive ?
this is the call center for service and information .
this is the kind of edu@@ cational sh@@ ame .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
we have the passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
you &apos;ll expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
they knew it was trick , right ?
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
now we do with dri@@ ll@@ and machines .
em@@ c is des &quot; called embra@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
we have all navi@@ systems in our cars .
and so it &apos;s not seen as a huge loss .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability legal movement .
we want to abo@@ mass mass car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
there creates a connection , reci@@ tual respect .
and we want to take it worldwide level .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right to do ?
they virtu@@ alize the reality . it has no computers .
i thought , let &apos;s bring pop pop work the second .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
so we &apos;re away before that , and where are we going ?
there &apos;s a program that some you might know about .
i just agre@@ agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
the under@@ water part is from a quar@@ ry .
people in in the door rooms are now getting in in .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
if you want , you creates hyper@@ links between the images .
and some of it worked and some didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
the kid in me is really excited about such possibilities .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty question is an interesting question .
do you want to be more attra@@ ctive and more dent ?
the first question is , are we really too many ?
i &apos;m going to talk today about un@@ expected discovery .
but you will no phosp@@ hor@@ us to be able to replace it .
tu@@ es@@ day adap@@ tation is totally over@@ ated .
when i say reality , picture reality .
a little more about you not you are .
i may have another 40 years of work .
do you know what the answer is ?
the dog ! i was l@@ o@@ ck .
i think it &apos;s important to uni@@ te both .
and what for you ? what it successful ?
at now now we &apos;re a far away from that dest@@ ination .
it was &quot; in forever , forever . &quot;
and it was same after the three months .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
then i say heart sorry , right ?
and yet we don &apos;t yet understand that possibilities .
you know he was here in 18@@ 35 .
it &apos;s right , moral , patent stuff .
the main problem is very similar like aids .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t tell tions about reality .
my mother suff@@ ered from the ght@@ f@@ es of the boat .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board anymore .
and we inv@@ ent as new as we want .
there &apos;s a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of this .
we see it in all sorts of human life .
these are people forming my global view .
and these results have achie@@ to hard through several weeks of hard work .
maybe i &apos;t want to be the needed need .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the ception here .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
it shows at other places of the book .
another favorite of me , star night .
and there , , ck@@ , , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies .
and i went over and i just listening .
why do i doing ? what comes out ? &quot;
this player is about an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
same , i think think we use games today .
and i said , &quot; yes , very love . &quot;
you can say things here that have on the world .
... please you just show the slide for a second .
i probably one of these fig@@ ures got to get very close to zero .
and in doing process , we trust and the rules of the game .
the first two sent@@ , they &apos;re logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make stat@@ ement about what &apos;s true .
now , think imagine two other little changes .
we actually know know something else is .
what left left is the story@@ telling .
we can continue these things in different examples .
do that , then then learn the sentence .
this shouldn &apos;t be a jo@@ now , but .
and that &apos;s just the message .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
how many would choose for good memory ?
so please listen when a music is played .
so , pull out and start inv@@ ent .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
that is an idea that &apos;s worth ading .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ rate the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable selling it .
and we can like to see that .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ ial of er@@ ror .
it changed my way of making films , complete .
but so what this image is for is a problem .
so that &apos;s the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
there are some places we can turn to .
the second factor is the services we use .
they &apos;re ab@@ qui@@ red and strange programs .
so here are some natural flies .
that means , ants wei@@ gh much more than us .
go and qu@@ qu@@ ard leon@@ ard . hen .
i said , &quot; go , grandmother . &quot;
because they have special cap@@ abilities .
his whole process has changed .
we called it the digital water pa@@ vil@@ li@@ on .
you can look around here in all these muse@@ ums .
how much money takes to realize that ?
lo@@ ans and spon@@ spon@@ sor@@ s were see@@ for .
and i took a while to find this .
think about it . this attack is general .
i want to tell you some of the puzz@@ le pieces .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classi@@ terms of play .
and if it don &apos;t , stu@@ x@@ net doesn &apos;t do anything .
and we &apos;ve made an i@@ pad ap@@ p .
this is further at the tree of life .
we didn &apos;t have polio polio in this country yesterday .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
they moved to a natur@@ alist concept .
and you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evol@@ forward .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
child mortality was down by a tent@@ h .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
there is no population population in trees .
so these women were meeting , and they just got each other .
every big picture is the da@@ wn of a section .
so he got the citizens to check them .
imagine a so@@ und@@ e e airplane .
he says , &quot; make for rise . &quot;
so we start with a windows dr@@ g .
and the third area , it actually explains itself .
they shared the king@@ dom into half half .
&quot; check your your p@@ ink .
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conver@@ sa@@ tions with all of you .
you zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can actually go in .
you must be willing to take risks of those .
if you have something to give , , &apos;ll give it now .
next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
coal , you heard a lot of it .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
i mean , that &apos;s a cognitive tra@@ p .
they teach them how open up do@@ ors .
so in other words i define what i want .
we re@@ tioned them . we re@@ pair them .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and s@@ hr@@ in@@ ates in summer .
so , it &apos;s also always interesting to knowledge as a designer .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and i see the same process in combin@@ ing photos .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different mar@@ al@@ ade .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
it &apos;s seen almost 200 million times this year .
not just bad , but most worst ever .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence we have to face .
or are you more like a down@@ at@@ tribu@@ te ?
you won &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
i see no reason why this shouldn be be .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , powerful , powerful .
and the world that we live in now now looks like this .
in fact , it &apos;s much dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
the only problem was she had 10 children .
i said , &quot; please fly . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bom@@ b .
but these are all the streets in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ a .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
play is the ti@@ de who st@@ ops us together .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently ?
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a little lau@@ gh .
and here are two patients . these are their record .
so , climate change will become terrible for you .
but the volu@@ me are far bigger than ever before .
i can &apos;t say it &apos;s good or bad .
so , gender can occu@@ r in many different vari@@ ants .
are you eight and den@@ able like 00@@ 7 ?
and less us@@ able or user friend@@ ly it is .
and anyway , you work much less than i did .
you never never get a task that you can to solve .
so how do we work when we look in this ?
he described one of them as very &quot; ordinary . &quot;
you may have heard that we built water@@ sig@@ ns .
as a result , we build stron@@ ger social relationships .
we run into the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
that &apos;s there there , that comes back .
i &apos;m never going to play the way i did at that moment .
mani@@ o@@ ok is something that half a billion people eat .
you can almost always great for less than 50 dollars .
wouldn &apos;t it more nice to open do@@ ors ?
and so were were the first of people developed game tools .
and there are projects like this at the government level .
so occu@@ py@@ thes@@ ec@@ ec@@ movement it .
i mean , i r@@ ar@@ ely saw flat lines .
but what about that day , that particular fri@@ day ?
i want to talk about the problem and and some few possible solutions .
it was developed up at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
here &apos;s the current version of this income .
we should put the bear in the c@@ age .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
the faces of the audience were very serious and carefully .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
they &apos;re getting a model that comes from all over the earth .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its each other .
and it &apos;s also deeply ro@@ ot@@ ed in our lives .
and you know what my answer is ?
we re@@ back to the re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
it was an extreme . it needed an extreme solution .
the living itself has no voice in that choice .
where &apos;s the greatest interest in doing that really do ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
now we &apos;re foc@@ using on fu@@ els of the fourth generation .
it &apos;s the form of behavior , right ?
at one place , the screen is fil@@ filled with leaves .
and also , energy energy is very important for them .
the grand@@ father of this old man re@@ f@@ ed .
how can i do something possible user user ly ?
this year , it &apos;s been looked up almost 50 million times .
every society is sha@@ ped by a primary medium .
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
they &apos;re standing in the united states , in europe and japan .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with that .
and no , it &apos;s not man or san francisco .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of the head moment .
because artists have a dist@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ o to lie .
now , chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ration .
and fl@@ ol@@ Ã© ! powered for you , all all this .
i &apos;m going to write writing , because that &apos;s my job .
i &apos;ll take this hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
well , we know everything about where our things come from .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can immer@@ ve in a decade .
well , we introduced ented the ma@@ yo@@ r of bel@@ hole .
so i say , start the world changing games .
because we don &apos;t longer making things free off .
he ste@@ aling every fif@@ th of hope from my consciousness .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of too many choices .
this is an inter@@ active film .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
we had no words for what we started .
i would rather on doing this work that i love .
in the future , most crime will play cri@@ mes online .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever ever sold . &quot;
this &apos;s great . here , digital ets the physical .
fr@@ ance makes one door . it@@ al@@ y is making a tor .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk here .
it &apos;s not even online . no stre@@ aming .
currently we &apos;re spending three billion hours a week playing online games .
also , urban designers and construction ers are very interested .
30 years ago , this would have quite ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
is it work for others or is it for us ?
but that was not the end of the th@@ yl@@ s .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
b@@ g : a energy break@@ through is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t com@@ mit yourself .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
in fact , gra@@ des are very va@@ gue and in@@ pre@@ cur@@ ity .
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a econom@@ ist .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s still put together .
&quot; is not &quot; pro@@ ved to be un@@ true .
and then we &apos;re off@@ ering one of this great dun@@ t .
now , in this area , there aren not many thousand thousand goals .
the cell communities started abstra@@ ating information .
and everybody knew it worked , right ?
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be with my glas@@ g@@ gles .
as i said , a a it just started .
he &apos;s now standing on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
how do you ju@@ dge people on their characteri@@ properties ?
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
but i really think something comes after us .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
the next step was to find the app@@ s do it .
what more me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses have you gone through ?
that const@@ ant feedback is not the real life .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as other br@@ ands .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
we know another one where the sta@@ tions are .
so the growth rate itself is acceler@@ ating .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you don &apos;t know anything possible in that gold@@ fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to explain him and explain it for you .
i &apos;m going to solve in a second , what &apos;s in there .
in both cases they got surgery , and they were doing fine .
and it says , &quot; put your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
so you can just go to google t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on natural user interface .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and you can see that green do@@ t there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one hero of mine .
i sell s@@ muse@@ ums all over the country , glob@@ right .
many of them are covered covered with faces and so forth .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn it around .
now , how do people die in a result of a hair ?
no , thro@@ wing away exactly the right thing , right ?
1@@ m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
that &apos;s how it really work at all for the memor@@ of self .
these are spaces that can intelligent to a person .
so , te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to that .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe like me .
a manhattan project project ? how do we get it ?
both cases would bed me , ask me .
that &apos;s thinking about the mo@@ t to mind .
we just fri@@ or@@ ing around around the way we ever could .
many talk about an 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 .
that &apos;s mostly our goal now .
so when sound says there is no sou@@ l .
i was actually obs@@ essed with studying the deep sea .
this , by the way , is the most dest part in my talk .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things all the same .
i can &apos;t play today as i years 20 .
as a kid , i kept draw com@@ ic books .
over the journey of of , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
when we start to think about it like way , everything changes everything .
this is star@@ star night , probably never seen this before .
our steps in di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zation of life were exponenti@@ al .
we have an abstra@@ ct of abstra@@ ct language .
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer p .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious .
but for the bottom billion billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with you .
i worked in a co@@ min@@ mine -- dangerous .
another example is so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called virtual reality .
and yet there &apos;s this mental dis@@ pl@@ ing .
... it attention to crow@@ d@@ source temp@@ t .
she had suff@@ ered a non ##AT##-##AT## @@ treat@@ cted brain dama@@ m .
it could be within a a time learning experience .
that means , that &apos;s the crime rates go back .
and of course , how re@@ design the influence on perception .
so how do a human deal out to certain things .
and then he was ot@@ ing , and he said , are that ?
they closed them to the venti@@ at machine .
ok , think of extreme of expression .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cro@@ ss@@ a@@ es against drugs .
what is the the nan@@ te machine age .
yet while , there is a political dis@@ h in our country .
ask ask , ask you the evidence , evidence it evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
everything that beautiful in life is not efficient .
and the fish was very enough to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
there &apos;s more behind this , it &apos;s even deeper .
but we know very little about where things are going .
the way it used to happen in the village .
i know what people think when they see that .
it &apos;s really about bringing different reality .
but actually , it was an more fun fun that night .
com@@ bine you can create something special like this .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no h@@ d , it was real .
what will they consu@@ me ? what will they want ?
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; auto@@ matically assem@@ fying stone . &quot;
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
because you know , that &apos;s a funny process .
we can put this time machine we want .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
well because they don &apos;t know it was different .
and that is in fact , a conser@@ va@@ tive guess .
it &apos;s not slow down for none of our big problems .
american america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
the idea is to che@@ at a digital security system .
this is an organis@@ m described in 199@@ 6 .
he took a famous photograph . how did it name ?
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
click , and w@@ um@@ ms , you are at this museum .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
i was not long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
we see the process fe@@ eding itself .
fro@@ sty , the guy gets clean every day .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ ti@@ fied place .
po@@ yl@@ rat@@ ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
because the images dro@@ it it for them .
that &apos;s great . i love plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
di@@ ph@@ tery , stro@@ man , polio ...
so i go back one step back and i give back the view .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable of people around the world .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
you can just name a few names and people will understand .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
she was a , strong woman , she had effect .
the bro@@ in@@ ers are still describe describe them as pri@@ st@@ ine .
so we should better better figure out out what the goal is .
so at the technology fli@@ cap@@ ds us .
so i know about some who didn &apos;t contribu@@ ted .
i &apos;ve med into war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous .
but what is trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
we had to worry about the law@@ law@@ and so on .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush ?
there are a lot of stories about why we did that .
but in the years , that was not that way .
and then &apos;ve up up a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and so he es@@ ws its ag@@ oni@@ zing conditions .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really serious ?
it &apos;s this extremely cious ta@@ vor .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
i &apos;m going to start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
this is a version of one thing that was done .
because the musical instrument is the exten@@ sion of our body .
it &apos;s like someone to beat the sun .
they were asked to report about your pain every 60 seconds .
well , energy has fallen over time .
can you imagine some good that coming from to@@ bac@@ co ?
my grand@@ father was in ja@@ il pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
a a baby needs about six thousand .
it caused im@@ se bi@@ lets in the control room .
in other words , game is our adap@@ ting jo@@ ker .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a spon@@ ge .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
this is not a craft and it &apos;s not agriculture .
sh@@ ri@@ mp eat phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
he lived lived nine and three years .
a few years ago i started developing li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ue .
imagine these ima@@ ctions could really start to fly .
what &apos;s this new state that the world is starting to to on ?
a friend of mine did -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
and my talk today will act act about these cognitive fall@@ fall .
open the map , and jump p a click .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s going to change .
it &apos;s also my big , li@@ fel@@ ong of love and fascin@@ ation .
and it &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so he &apos;s logi@@ cal .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound sound paper .
you know , we hear a whole lot about transpar@@ ency .
and the predic@@ tions , as you read it , they are serious .
please follow me , because the circle will connect again .
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol in@@ duced diseases .
and i think technology is going to be more important in our modern societies .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and even today , we &apos;re still depen@@ very , very deeply to stories .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was lo@@ ving .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
i have a friend who goes a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
you have to ad@@ mit that this is a big choice .
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m technology to spread .
we also brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools .
let &apos;s call the cu@@ er , it costs lots of money .
these are the kinds of questions we need to meet .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
why are you going to adverti@@ around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
that &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ se debate . it &apos;s got stop it .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against in@@ justice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
you &apos;re always worried that you &apos;re losing right .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here .
50 percent of their decisions have been met in nine minutes in nine minutes .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
we need to start by changing the real world into a game .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular community .
but my logi@@ cal page didn &apos;t like it either .
this is the period that you fall in love .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
if one neighb@@ or helps helps the other , we streng@@ force our communities .
i mean , how much to@@ es of our memor@@ ies ?
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this is the really cool part , called the colle@@ ctions .
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
and because we grow older , the wind@@ a@@ ies get larger .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the stat@@ of &apos; movie .
i just want to say a brie@@ bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
but you can , if you &apos;re in foreign .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
the doctor says , &quot; but &apos;m not not . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s cle@@ an@@ ating the water .
we have the capital of tech@@ no@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward that . thank you .
and then i immediately immediately , that is un@@ fair .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
and the movie will called &quot; the greatest movie ever ever . &quot;
secon@@ dly , combin@@ ed photos should the same kind of ligh@@ ting .
and also , you would think in the mind today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it will give you .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and the oil will be re@@ placed with other energy ri@@ ers .
bla@@ ise , this is really incredible . heart at@@ u@@ lations .
10 minutes later the ju@@ dge left a pause .
like al@@ gen and other terri@@ ary things .
just that i think he &apos;s of to like it doesn &apos;t know .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat well .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has magic cians .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i mentioned the news to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he was no@@ ding .
that &apos;s a lot of dea@@ by mas@@ mas@@ , , 20 per hour .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
i mean , ask ourselves why do we fight it ?
but it turns out it &apos;s not there .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for fla@@ vor .
and yeah , i have a task , , as you may recognize .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t create it .
for example , this person who is completely logi@@ cal .
that all of our survival is connected to every individual .
so the pain@@ ink the the gut the better the system . &quot;
the more money you make , the more content you are .
this approach app@@ lies of the new to what we &apos;re creative .
and they ligh@@ out through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
we &apos;ve moved ted before in what &apos;s called the a@@ age age .
well , their living survival is not going to get happ@@ ier .
that &apos;s the publi@@ cation that &apos;ve just just done recently .
somewhere here , a series of photographs -- here you are .
we talk about a 300 when a bat 300 hits hits .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all sorts of recogni@@ tion .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been her this morning , &quot; he said .
this is 20 feet of sea , like green@@ land .
here is a picture of a orange in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
in 2010 , we had just connected connected under two billion people under two billion people online .
i studied woman dru@@ inter@@ ter , and she was brea@@ thing .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ to someone here in this audience .
and this was the first time i learned this myself .
a very specific wish for to inv@@ ent this technology .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
i can say the minister is a man .
i now know it was the cause of the ocean .
he &apos;s got a for@@ ing ing of 15 to one .
and all the time i started cted more more and more .
it was completely clu@@ ded that she could fail .
even who kill@@ s someone , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer .
and this video had actually been ser@@ ated in janu@@ ary .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ins in par@@ ad@@ ise .
they interact in appar@@ ously interact with their environment , and their experiences .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of strange ones .
this trick can do your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
we &apos;ve been in h@@ oll@@ and now over three years .
so , &apos;s what what got me really right , and i wanted to get more .
yes , this is what looks down there is the bur@@ load .
the invention of language , for example , was a small step in this direction .
based on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
there &apos;s many more , but i have the time .
the fact is that un@@ inse@@ ty should worry us .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
and the next interesting stage took about another another billion years .
a few months months went over and i had for@@ gotten everything .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes up .
each of these the@@ mes was made of of many , many smaller decisions .
a government is absolutely necessary but it needs to get efficient .
and all , he didn &apos;t longer seem more human@@ ure human .
and i celebra@@ te , i ry like a little child .
players are ma@@ on the spi@@ ders den@@ se social nets .
so , people in the west have spent a long time about creativity .
when you &apos;re happy , you engage other happy people .
b has these benefits and risks . you want to do ?
so , of the same , bad bad team of one was under the best .
and of course they can never exist in germany . &quot;
a con@@ sequence was that the phone was never broken .
and the more that i was talking , the more i was supposed to tell .
how can we trans@@ fer these feelings from play to play into reality ?
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
and i don &apos;t just mean less success@@ fully , although that &apos;s part of it .
an amazing er@@ ror quote . one in nine inno@@ cent .
or you want to be fit@@ fit@@ , more , , have more power .
my great@@ grand@@ parents all died when they were 60 .
that &apos;s the piece of metal about in a second .
now , where are we supposed to go : what is the right approach ?
these are they &apos;re all all in the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ wind period .
in it , they want up by the end of the gan@@ .
and then people could eat it and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
i had a 14@@ year ##AT##-##AT## old , poor black boy as mand@@ date .
we &apos;ve used to things lin@@ ear happen .
that &apos;s somebody , by the ally , ves four of 10 .
very r@@ , you &apos;re actually wit@@ of a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
so i want to give you two two , maybe three examples of this .
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are possibilities everywhere
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
please wel@@ wel@@ come fear . please wel@@ come the risk .
they can throw them away where they go and they stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire@@ department .
they did that by de@@ ec@@ ting the country .
the things that only being used are go into technical systems .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
then let &apos;s project this analog@@ y into the future .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean carbon technology .
so nothing has changed , and everything everything changed .
are you so far ? you look a little bit nervous .
so if you could turn the light again .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
we &apos;ve just passed the seven billion dollar brand .
so the device you see , it didn &apos;t work .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and as i turn around , the fing@@ ers changes its position .
it looks pretty like , like alt@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ ble language .
and in ber@@ lin , a crazy engineering collective .
now that already already for the first year , half of his value .
i &apos;m sorry i have to cut short so hard .
we &apos;re talking about the stream of information information .
there is a direct feedback nam@@ for this .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s who look at this video .
and part of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
we see this that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really cri@@ critical .
and sure , we can find fast food ins .
everything that beautiful in life is not efficient .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting in vision .
and i think it causes the world looks this .
so software software software co@@ ation usually takes a few years .
now where would you posi@@ fy your brain on that scale ?
now , how do you speak the language of music ?
we need to engage into the machin@@ ery of government .
i sent sent her home without talking to my su@@ at@@ cian .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
and what noticed was it needed an an t .
and i told them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
because that &apos;s where government is happening .
the cost of solar energy was down 50 percent last year .
it has moments of of life , one by another .
secon@@ dly what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ it costs .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it was not a a poetry .
the previous previous example was about finding details .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we all all that .
i &apos;ll expla@@ ining what these sounds what these sounds might have to mean .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
again again , what potential would we want to call ?
because all of these new technologies of now to eding themselves .
if it didn &apos;t move , you would bu@@ y them .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what a truly fantastic .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that either . our health system is mi@@ es .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i knew she had come to say .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask ask .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
because their life depen@@ ded on whether they were doing the job right .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
and other other example are ambi@@ tious , intelligent systems .
so you &apos;re move around and you &apos;re making art instal@@ lations like this .
that &apos;s why you help along , ask , , , the folks .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it sm@@ ells well .
i believe in it and i feel like we should teach that .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art art now provi@@ ers you 100,000 products .
you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
the program i use here is a little experiment .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own ep@@ c game .
would you you want to to make these changes in your genes ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
but also our our perception of how how fa@@ ke us as well .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal site says .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
how many do@@ ors has the house that you live in ?
when we looked at how to v@@ fy feelings with income .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost of our eyes .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
what one of a farm not feed feed your animals ?
i went home through emergen@@ cy office on my way .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
today we don &apos;t just find gen@@ pleasure to something we do with .
and then we started started to negoti@@ ate with the insu@@ ol@@ ans .
i was sho@@ cked and pulled into the inside .
but now , i &apos;m going to &apos; it little curious about this .
most of my day , i got two hat@@ ks .
you see the person who &apos;s going to wonder what &apos;s happening inside them .
the words , as long his friends , now mo@@ cked his .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
what it ru@@ in was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
and , , , first , of all , ask what the right thing is .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped her life .
and it turns out that , dna is syn@@ the@@ zation is very difficult ging .
that kee@@ ps us away away and lets us evol@@ ve .
there &apos;s a step step an@@ ual there .
now , memory self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
i stopped &apos;t fighting with my wife two years .
this first , that was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next days .
so , my gentle@@ man , can you help me ? i need help .
the re@@ ph@@ ation is death is part of life .
i started thinking think that i should just put the project in .
the pilot built the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
we have lots of cells that are no longer left on alone .
so the driving force behind this is cyber@@ ber super@@ power .
you know how many decisions you make a typical day ?
it pi@@ cks about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous los@@ ses .
is it impossible to say how the photograph was actually com@@ posed .
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
he &apos;s quite happy about it because he dec@@ ei@@ ved you .
and more people came in , just because they were an@@ gry .
and we found that there was actually a cor@@ ct .
we think about our future as predic@@ memor@@ ings .
because the music is a language and a language is a there to communicate .
i want to show you the recent project we &apos;re working .
this was happened . not a team had a stable structure .
these images are extraordinary , because the is going very fast .
now it &apos;s a pretty stun@@ ling invention when you think about it .
a fish up fish , also also a bird reser@@ ve .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
we know that money is very important , and tar@@ gets are very important .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
yet , we still come to the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
because through marine prote@@ cted areas we &apos;re re@@ back the past .
how do i look like i could possibly put down a song ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
so now we ste@@ cked the time again .
sometimes i &apos;m lose the balance balance . there &apos;s a story to the end .
but it &apos;s of course , , the sum of , a lot of ideas .
it &apos;s the question of whether you get that up to zero .
of course , we can look at at g@@ arb@@ age first .
just for pre@@ cise new@@ spa@@ ods , they agree agree .
so the question is , how do we deal with these di@@ a@@ ines ?
so in these days , evolution can happen in the time period of micro@@ seconds .
so , for example , make the environment , st@@ less car .
you have to introdu@@ ce the enormous challenges you have to face .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean here an technical definition of the platform .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
most of you are completely completely ignor@@ ed themselves .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
i want to close with a story that really really excited me .
so you can ask : how happy is the living itself ?
has one one in the audience ever ever seen anyone die of mas@@ ks ?
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
you can test it after my talk in in your rooms .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
and lives lived in the coast coast of british colum@@ bia .
she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous move of air .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only get worse .
that too , so in every store , you can get things back .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ es ?
so if i hold you next to each other , this makes your interest .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
we are cases of us case like dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
i was the only person to to the air@@ line .
and this is what happened in the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
they dar@@ ken their ur@@ ine . they do almost never do .
but where would the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
the most powerful min@@ ker is head head mas@@ sey coal .
but in my humanity , i also gave my e@@ go space .
almost as like we &apos;re pre@@ pre@@ p@@ are for it all our lives .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go that way .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it very much later .
we thought thought found it in the happiness of survi@@ living itself .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of me@@ d@@ al
so the a@@ wards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
this is an fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you go on .
think of this as a image , a flying point .
they have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to completely design your car .
and interest@@ ingly , o also is a ted prize .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an book .
this is the source of most coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
so most of people usually to ch themselves to ori@@ ent in the task of task .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just out of our heads .
when they run , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ves the floor .
that will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we all have to believe at the end things that we can &apos;t see .
if we over@@ ag@@ at it , we can give back a little bit .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes modern make modern progress .
this is a whole book , an example of non ##AT##-##AT## @@ images data .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he called mi@@ gu@@ el .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
i was given the mira@@ cle part not not to die that day .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ freedom is ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze a choice .
i really like your kind , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in .
then the same thing happens in a good , well ##AT##-##AT## @@ fair conversation .
we take images of these min@@ -@@ butt@@ bs in dete@@ c@@ tors .
because he doesn &apos;t know what ha@@ y@@ pi@@ sts to go first .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ impro@@ gra@@ fication .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we can switch from the poster to a physical physical view of this environment .
car colors , the car -- i have 5@@ 6 possibilities .
and as a term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ t@@ need essi@@ ties .
it &apos;s not even , to me , doesn &apos;t even from the muse@@ ums .
here is pre@@ f@@ ting a very rare gli@@ ar .
so you you see , this film , we were going to tell the real version .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s suppor@@ ted .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you here on this journey .
and i thought , it &apos;s going to get so hard , so pain@@ ful .
mt will be part of the show , which is pretty failure .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
and that &apos;s the value of that experience , such a very simple exercise .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
w@@ r want to help people who con@@ vi@@ cted inno@@ cent .
and the best part is possibly affec@@ cts us in health .
we &apos;re and@@ and@@ , and we &apos;re talking to and@@ ro@@ gens .
that is , we &apos;re useful , are not less har@@ m@@ ful in it .
we could , of course , reduce by by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i sort sort of think about it , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and that means fre@@ free access , which means means open and productive .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy today of 15 15 percent .
but as you talked to different people around the world about these possibilities .
let &apos;s quickly jump to mom@@ a again in new york .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is an innovation innovation innovation today .
they feel that that &apos;s the actual truth behind out@@ comes .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are combin@@ ed with chimpanze@@ es , our s@@ est living rela@@ tives .
now he mentioned the miner@@ needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
the first of these drop is a con@@ tradi@@ tive to ad@@ mit complexity .
i &apos;d want to help you to a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
usually you &apos;re kind kind of stand , and some come , some don &apos;t .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran to the older black .
i don &apos;t know how recei@@ people will be .
they invest spending most of their time in these assem@@ bling structures all the time .
you &apos;re about the block and take it as an re@@ ph@@ any .
i can brea@@ the the the audience consci@@ ously or un@@ conscious .
but the question i want to stop is : why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks we went back to temp@@ &apos;s room .
because frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the ju@@ dge looks it as adults , but i see a child .
ce@@ os are something about average . but here it gets interesting .
here is one of of by the way , that men are not pig@@ s .
i didn &apos;t learned to do this in my work as the law@@ yer .
and i hope you &apos;ll play and play with me like this .
and in a few years le@@ go go moved into every hou@@ se@@ hold .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of it .
and i really want to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
here &apos;m exp@@ ing it a . . we &apos;re looking right here at the center .
so i decided , when i was 15 to get di@@ ving .
this image , for example is about 10 billion billion visu@@ ctions , i think .
an@@ 6 : social dec@@ line number 7 : 65 were dying .
new invest@@ ments to create well ##AT##-##AT## @@ paid jobs .
fire@@ flies in a glass , i found always quite exciting .
from my eye , i saw the jan@@ it@@ r and down .
in many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re nu@@ ts ! that &apos;s good .
the x ##AT##-##AT## @@ interpretation of a piece is this compar@@ able .
long time ago there was wh@@ ales -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player will be@@ f@@ ely three out of 10 clu@@ kes .
and guess what we found in the fear code ?
when you look at the people that they have to do with ...
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
and they did this with so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called le@@ ad@@ land@@ cards .
imagine that single one of people is gover@@ ated .
how about the that we can &apos;t &apos;t even predict ?
okay , let me squ@@ some blood out for you .
but instead of getting into pan@@ cked , he just stopped stopped .
he invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
and that &apos;s also what i had the last half f ##AT##-##AT## @@ year .
but somehow we &apos;re manage to step ourselves off this problem .
i like things that are que@@ li@@ er . i like od@@ d things .
turned turned the g@@ arb@@ ton@@ ton to the side side . went home .
it was always so inspired spir@@ , up@@ wing .
of course , this cannot &apos;t done by a human machine leader .
but cri@@ tically , if i &apos;m right , it just just true .
we hate a power@@ strong government . we don &apos;t trust in the system .
i first e@@ aten him at a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ cker ers now , the individual people .
here you &apos;re a ex@@ pt of this attack king code .
so i &apos;ve bus@@ doing , when &apos;s of natural or intui@@ tive .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ dep@@ end on all humanity .
this was me hit when i wanted to share my je@@ ans .
so maybe you should put some of this before the interview . &quot;
we de@@ de@@ grade a person who has worth value to our society .
it means we have a cultural influence bes@@ bes@@ i@@ des the scientific .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america defin@@ defined by er@@ ror .
well , actually , the number of violence didn &apos;t change much .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ ths don &apos;t come to trial .
what about children &apos;s polio ? let &apos;s take it . why not ?
we &apos;ve an@@ ged his bed so he can see out outside .
all of these air@@ port has an area of 100 square kilometers .
we emplo@@ using games to es@@ cape the suffering of the real world .
and six milli@@ seconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
so it turns out be very hard to get all all these di@@ sions .
this goes back a lot further , into cultures of the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial times .
our gut is a wonder@@ gor@@ hospit@@ ous environment for these bacteria .
about that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you may know .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let down .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s so self ##AT##-##AT## @@ own .
the biggest sc@@ ared of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
someone had broken cked and and really ha@@ ed the system .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
but in the te from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
that actually actually adop@@ ted a thousand eight really shape , these these networks .
it don &apos;t need to whi@@ st@@ le a lo@@ lo@@ let or sing@@ ing .
so , i think it &apos;s a a very yellow ha@@ ck .
i &apos;ve brought seven couple of under@@ pants , and that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange high@@ way .
now , i thought , how can i really get this out ?
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how he did he become a fish exper@@ ?
i think sort of a six@@ six dollars or something .
there was the the research research called le@@ o@@ po@@ dd@@ port .
now , the living itself lives its life continu@@ continu@@ ously .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
there &apos;s a enormous wave of interest in interest in interest among the researchers .
well , the two kinds of self throw two terms from happiness .
pictures like this : a construction along a much driving road .
i grew up with a dead por@@ of science fi@@ ction .
an ei@@ ght ##AT##-##AT## @@ one played brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building exten@@ sive , not inten@@ sive .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all miner@@ al .
and i &apos;m not sure they they really stay here .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
they increase the paraly@@ sis and they lower happiness .
now , that night , everyone went to the center to celebra@@ te .
the interesting thing is , once i can make a little trip .
on average on it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
the com@@ er becomes more and more friend that you live with .
so , here was a company that was trying to do it right .
how can a ju@@ dge can turn someone into something that it isn &apos;t ?
so find find programs that can sort the most est numbers .
in many areas , people had to to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch mo@@ bs .
so a few years ago , i years on to do that .
is it as clear that the answer to the question is : you .
a few . probably , about as many as there are creative creative people here .
they were producing the highest construction at the time .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of con@@ stra@@ ts .
and i was like , &quot; so how do you communic@@ ating ? &quot;
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what represents the red ?
finally , at the scre@@ ession , we should wel@@ wel@@ come the fear .
there was , in my opini@@ on , a pretty good code comes emerging .
this is actually the true loss of human and machine .
in fact , nasa showed a lot of stuff out there .
on the ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ meta@@ physical physical view .
how about a set of new new , never heard ed .
possibilities that wouldn not have allowed were sever@@ tically encoura@@ ged .
for example , the fish was taken on a re@@ trip .
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ able design .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
basically essentially the con@@ cre@@ te block was block of our time .
my inspiration comes from an event that goes 2,@@ 500 years .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
it are the rene@@ w@@ ables energy , as they &apos;re called frequ@@ ently .
and the best part of this is that they &apos;re to to up to magne@@ ts .
and then i made my first mistake ; i &apos;d send her home .
the not@@ ed gra@@ des have the function of letters of a writing .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , really changed my life .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions people on the planet .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
at the last ted conference , i gave a performance to the l@@ h@@ c .
the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;ve been a few talks in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
i ask , how more compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , really really bad things happen .
i looked in the bar and it was a little bit p@@ ink .
this is a fish in the sou@@ western corner spa@@ in .
and so that &apos;s what we did out of of co@@ de ##AT##-##AT## @@ de ##AT##-##AT## @@ state condu@@ ct .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular o .
some of my p@@ ps happened over the last five years .
then these are influ@@ ences in pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial cultures .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed photographs should have the same of perspective .
that &apos;s why dra@@ matic high numbers come coming to prison in@@ mates .
what kind of context is that in the thought and feelings of you of yourself ?
now , what does this have to with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
but nothing was invented invented that let me go again , until now .
a kid in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key . &quot;
so that &apos;s just an app@@ p of many that you can do with this .
so this is my wir@@ i wa@@ age . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths went through through dri@@ a@@ ing .
that means you were navi@@ gate about sound and over rhyth@@ m .
this actually really just just a period of 2 1 and two weeks .
when someone lies , you &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
so all these green areas , these are the most most ous environments .
we &apos;re towards collabor@@ ative thinking , heart beings .
even if you were sho@@ ot@@ yourself , you would have emissions .
and that is called and@@ ro@@ re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
do you know how &apos;s a a 3@@ ter ter in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 price of software for the w@@ inner .
and the cri@@ cial indi@@ c@@ ator for that is the extin@@ ction of the languages .
so i want to enter this machine , and i want to go into the future .
most of most people know this from the software field .
these people will be connected to the movie in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty -- forever .
and i had to explain the journ@@ alists that there &apos;s &apos;t that test .
and pretty soon after , i wrote an article on on gene@@ -@@ alter@@ fo@@ ods .
and so , i think the ted community should be bra@@ per .
you learn to the sounds to the notes on the instrument .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank ted .
it &apos;s our new home country , called n@@ un@@ a@@ ut .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to as a ph@@ d student .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can look at it .
i believe in too many places , the opposite is poverty is poverty .
well , finally the film ear@@ red a very large moment@@ .
and it &apos;s spread ri@@ tion@@ ly , organic , of course .
right now , it &apos;s in the moment , but we &apos;ve got an incredible opportunity .
there was currently when b@@ ach s as an instrument , there was no piano .
we &apos;ll find other fe@@ i@@ ties about what their rights are .
one day , that mirror , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful .
so in our culture a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
if you could only have one of those , it would be a completely different world .
this piece of 50 year ##AT##-##AT## old technology became the most gical thing for me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you &apos;ve got to go into the house .
it &apos;s about creating pping out of of goods .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it .
that is our yo@@ est be@@ ta@@ -@@ te@@ ster down there on the lower right .
i &apos;m sad that we never never know each other as adults .
and somehow , we need to cause changes that lower that to zero .
this is the period of most per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
and when i listen@@ to her , she made ke@@ o@@ ing sounds .
by late mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be oper@@ able .
and therefore , when we think about it have an interesting situation in face .
if you could do it for those , they could help me also .
and just just how all these companies disappe@@ ared , one after the time .
if in fact , we don &apos;t record and leave any phosp@@ hor@@ us .
so if we do something about the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and i was good , i finished up c@@ um de .
the people here have contribu@@ ted to to a lot of these mira@@ cles .
we &apos;ve distribu@@ ted li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ue to children , and they can see playing with it .
but on youtube , plo@@ plo@@ over 4@@ 8 hours of video per minute .
speci@@ alized skills and processes skills and combin@@ ation lead to success .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk back to tony .
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vi@@ vi@@ cin@@ ert .
l@@ and and se@@ points , f , b , b ce@@ , etc .
man is supposed to come from the mon@@ keys or have a common ance@@ st@@ or .
one is &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other is &quot; s@@ wing .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i like lots of black colors , a lot of gra@@ y , and things of stuff .
what were its circum@@ of life , how about the society and the politics ?
on september 10@@ th of last year , the machine was running for the first time .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish don &apos;t give the same rights as a human .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely in@@ intui@@ tive .
i love this : &quot; wat@@ son forced human ene@@ my . &quot;
we want to use that a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
three months later , i was house , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ ed .
i don &apos;t know what they hold me , but i can live with that .
and this is something we need to learn , and very fast .
here &apos;s where the more you around , the better .
people said , &quot; do you not be afraid to never succe@@ ed ?
this is all reality today , and in the future will be much more possible .
so this allows the to to growing bon@@ ds , trust and together .
in my opini@@ on , mass car@@ cky have basically changed our world .
she said , &quot; you &apos;s going to do very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
but at the same , we need good amount of intuition to actually per@@ ute the experiments .
i got in the car , and i really over@@ blo@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
in the short time here , i realized one one thing : ted has an identity .
so , sa@@ dly , we have god &apos;s gra@@ of a piece of un@@ learned .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , come back .
1@@ 8 : tsun@@ am@@ ning . speak@@ 9 : cyber@@ attac@@ ks .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
&quot; do you remember the patient they sent them home ? &quot;
they &apos;re just exchange changing building building homes against the cities .
even if it seems har@@ ely appropriate , may may be the most necessary .
now there &apos;s all this little m@@ um before the great re@@ v@@ ei@@ ation .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , to be least bad .
and that is so that you can just app@@ ying this lo@@ gic wrong .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent covered with water .
and often the music is is so you you learn to read the notes .
because that &apos;s only the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
and i tend to think of wi@@ der@@ sity as my sha@@ dow .
because a good engineer has either been building great cars or nuclear power facili@@ ties .
this is naturally ently out of asia , in the tra@@ p of japan .
they r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it . . call .
the offi@@ cial faith message of all western industri@@ alized societies .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and that &apos;s already , you see what enormous enormous speed opportunities are there .
so i sat down , and you played playing the ted@@ talk .
we should be able to rock everything that we want .
they can have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , if they &apos;re not there .
el@@ ent@@ ous studies were condu@@ cted to see if that was true .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other technology of government does .
so that was the very first beginning of a own musical expression .
it &apos;s said you never the names of who the extin@@ ation .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how i can cut them apart .
but if i ask you , but how you you about your wife ?
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will we address us ?
you collect information about the play in the second liter@@ ature .
what they need is an environment that gives you to to it .
but what if the image conne@@ cts her with all its images ?
and as i say the justice , this un@@ pleas@@ comfortable is gone .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking to the history of an@@ atom@@ y .
before before cut close this talk , i &apos;d like to share to you about my grandmother .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and star@@ look at me .
big data is formed for organizations around the world are trans@@ formed into major opportunities .
it &apos;s also a re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time 3d scan , and a movement shot .
it &apos;s something we work on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
you agre@@ ed to him him free if it fa@@ fast .
she &apos;s the last defen@@ se before something comes into the body .
mean@@ now , lots lot people people and they can all get involved .
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
why why am i prevent from my audience that it to ac@@ action , too ?
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology on the way , nan@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ materials .
if you do a repe@@ it@@ lation and never make the mistakes again .
listen consci@@ ously and tell whether it taste it or not .
and not the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice it .
because it calls o@@ a o@@ something that has lost in a lost .
to hold me degree straight directly the com@@ pos@@ er .
let let start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
how well do you think you &apos;re you to deal with it ?
we can , , ely in this way we can get nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
he he ended the whole of thought , and he did something completely new .
beyond the simple games , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ leb@@ is is actually pretty powerful .
and that &apos;s one of the three major sources of the ones that that exi@@ sting problems today .
in our think , , we getting into all sorts of in@@ conven@@ ward areas .
it was when it@@ al@@ y won the foot@@ ball world c@@ pi@@ ship .
if i don &apos;t right , the chan@@ er is not a man .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we get ourselves in telling stories .
and that then turn es , the the head@@ words of open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them has suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
we can better deal with more categ@@ ories than with more choices .
critical tool of information communication have have been since stories .
they knew all bits bits and b@@ tes that they had to attack .
okay . everyone who is willing to embra@@ ce g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
you basically learn learning first to first , you just just just one word .
now we know about nine cities that are planning to use these ap@@ p .
a de@@ ception is really for for something because somebody percei@@ ves it .
br@@ y@@ an , they actually brought a string string here vi@@ b@@ inging .
sometimes , ideas ideas are hur@@ ahead ahead to our thinking in a very important way .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and on .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child children . and you know what ?
and it was much worse for a than for b &apos;s for memory .
the future is here . wind , sun and new energy system .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
it bring ima@@ and text , and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
all par@@ ties , all society &apos;s fra@@ ctions , suppor@@ ted this .
should &apos;s be there for your contribu@@ te whatever whatever he wants to be .
and look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
the frame@@ work work from la@@ da@@ d@@ les came from the rest of the world .
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ al was to build a lot of other carbon fac@@ tor@@ ies .
and you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
the reason : the government could track where a text came from .
so how do we oper@@ to alize the question oper@@ alize the characteri@@ stics of the character ?
and these app@@ s are us use our hands to order en@@ h@@ ance our communities .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design video games .
and today we all all feel as ow@@ ner ners our pop culture .
i &apos;ve down down four four words words , and they &apos;d like to explain to you brie@@ fly .
and not even like a technology company , rather like the internet itself .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain myself .
and we became a four and a half half time for a right family .
and all i can say about is : why do we fight this ?
but even in that limited perspective , we can do a lot of things .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
but this picture is actually completely com@@ posed to picture picture of pictures of different places .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a talk at ted@@ global .
i don &apos;t need to say but vac@@ cin@@ es are cru@@ essential .
the first point of the letter , you only until you you can to tell the language about it .
and i think it begins with a medical cian and it &apos;s me .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and that is a min@@ process that i think is appropri@@ ately .
each one of you could be famous famous on the internet to next satur@@ day .
we know something about what determin@@ es the happiness of happiness itself .
today we can show strate to do@@ zens of companies that have just just exactly this .
to put it my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish fish to birds .
if your work fle@@ w -- not quite your mistake , right ?
i said , &quot; don , what for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
he liber@@ ated us one of the worst g@@ o@@ les of humanity .
and who@@ ever &apos;s research research , that this is particularly true to men .
but now no longer at the local level , but on a global level .
photographs where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and cor@@ relation .
&quot; do you remember ra@@ kes with the patient with the te@@ e ? &quot;
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to go from two to to five billion internet users .
they are people who believe that they can change the world .
interpre@@ ts are transl@@ ors of the written written notes in clinical music .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure partner .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give that to the head of our country ! &quot;
my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
to writing books is my job , but it &apos;s &apos;s more than that .
and if i &apos;m right , the se@@ er is a man .
we type p , we &apos;ll ce it , we &apos;ll go eat food , that &apos;s okay .
that shows the tremend@@ big role can play a marine prote@@ area .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
because when the water flo@@ ws out , it &apos;s sin@@ k in the atlan@@ tic .
and the most important , is to look at the ground , first of all .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : a s . surprise .
we think we &apos;re &apos;t really as good as we as in play .
and then pi@@ ming up st@@ cks so he &apos;ll lock you the vision .
and at the end , you just want to get the her@@ it@@ ic rema@@ ins .
because it &apos;s un@@ comfortable to walk and take the nutri@@ ents .
now this is a three sentence that descri@@ a lo@@ gic of us .
talk to me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it get us ?
and this search took me to the old gre@@ e@@ ce , and the old ro@@ me .
but only until i turned 30 i really understood what that means .
but there &apos;s one key difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was just for experts .
and they developed great app@@ app@@ there , they worked with city collabor@@ ators .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
and that is the key issue from the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
a nuclear nuclear re@@ actor actor that provi@@ ers even a solution the tr@@ ash .

you might think that he was hun@@ asing fin@@ k , but that &apos;s not true .
almost hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out with this .
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
if we look ahead , these kinds of changes will become increasingly possible .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately the skep@@ tics live in very different cam@@ ps .

this is not poli@@ poli@@ tically active , this is bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic being active .
i grew up with a mother who taught me day after day .

if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see it here .
when we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 look like ?
now any paraly@@ zed can actually communicate or draw their eyes alone .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t like a scientist want to come with this .

a piece of art you never look at has no forces to effect .

why don &apos;t &apos;t we sing ing to get up from a to b ?
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show other environments .
and we take them back in a con@@ temporary history for children .
there are effects you can change live , such as hall and fil@@ ters .
and it was working for a time until i met a woman prin@@ ter .
who can taste a fish so good after it coo@@ ok ?
beautiful beach . great day . you have all for yourself .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or is doing in the conne@@ ment machine .
why is it in play to think that you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
now in practice practice , people are not te@@ sted for their chromo@@ some .
it turned out he &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ ok infe@@ ction .
but when they do it , then most of drin@@ king water will fall away .
why didn &apos;t i ask the physi@@ cian ? why did i bring her home ?
and , instead of just just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- love to play their life .
but think in a way that integr@@ ated in our own life .
i sta@@ ed , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
she looks at him and she says , &quot; i &apos;m for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
there &apos;s only one , and those are the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
go from from the little choice to the many , you stay there .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child against child sis . . no way .
it &apos;s impossible to present things in a society that has to work .
and then he ad@@ in , &quot; we &apos;re basically an own world .
the continu@@ ual report , today with music , there &apos;s not susta@@ ing .
the pilot had used the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
i &apos;ll take something that obviously obviously de@@ ception and i make it look real .
he said , &quot; no . you do the food is better . &quot;
they didn &apos;t eat , they thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
each red a large spo@@ on , so we wel@@ come the risk .
it &apos;s not about sc@@ ar@@ city ; the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
we we don &apos;t choose choose the experience . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
we are not reali@@ sts , we enjoy . we are lo@@ vers .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ?
that &apos;s okay , they &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
there &apos;ve already built two cities in china , and the third one is prepar@@ ation .
does it allow chemistry to make these really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
but spa@@ tial order of the images is actually important .
so i can zo@@ om in into my lost line in a given line frame .
that meant that he was being killed while during chinese invasi@@ on .
and it wasn not for my upp@@ b ; he was very love .
don &apos;t you worry that you killing you hu@@ mili@@ ation of a ement ?
in other words , every step here is a poten@@ cy on performance scale .
then the next generation came where we &apos;re actually actually our primary life today .
or , what was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something .
they can only be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
he &apos;s just developed with a few other people developed a ro@@ ta@@ vi@@ us ##AT##-##AT## @@ v@@ acc@@ ine .
a citizens helped a different citizens , but the government is , it played a central role .
in 197@@ 2 were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people stick and in prison .
and i can re@@ re@@ back everything that i &apos;ve been looked at today .
so to get audi@@ ble only what they only imag@@ of in the mind .
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
you can see it a second , but you can also look away if you want .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an des@@ d@@ able cla@@ cket .
but for the afri@@ can@@ american in this country it was a age of ter@@ ror .
to to really close close , you can go to your cra@@ cks .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full ev@@ ator ?
if you want to know , these other spi@@ kes are also fri@@ days .
and then i took a seas@@ pi@@ ar and connected that in it .
but don don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand about classi@@ cal music .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known among the pri@@ mates .
they &apos;re designed to be light , clay , motor and sen@@ sor .
and we can turn on this big battery with two milli@@ seconds to go out .
but cru@@ tically about this study was that the teachers were not divi@@ ed .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , part@@ tion communities and un@@ expected .
we &apos;ve got 30 gi@@ ga@@ watt ts photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics today .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s in virg@@ ini@@ a as a sla@@ ve .
so at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
what scri@@ books could you write to write in which you ad@@ have that thing ?
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the big c@@ ech@@ politi@@ cian once said .
because you do this like you called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain bear .
i &apos;ve the time , ge@@ other@@ mal mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
that &apos;s the taking back to two billion years of labor experience .
over time there there are little left , and we think that &apos;s de@@ normal value .
you see the top top that his chromo@@ some just fall@@ fall apart .
and you can do this through these ways , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame , recor@@ proper@@ right .
and that hasn &apos;t work out , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
because of course , this is a picture you cannot record with your camera .
lights , sounds , solar solar , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
i went there because i was growing up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
if you grow more wind to each , the system begins to fail .
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer from pla@@ d@@ ough that fear in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
the basis for many of it are technologies , and they are growing ex@@ poten@@ tent .
in these recor@@ ds there there was a fol@@ der called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
here &apos;s the state of the whole demon@@ stration i &apos;ve kept to to this .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody is talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
in of part to these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so is is co ##AT##-##AT## @@ these places in places .
i said , &quot; yes , &quot; and then we started discus@@ sing .
we do this in china for example , where we directly straight the waste waste directly .
until until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
front is a beautiful beautiful fully d@@ ded sho@@ w@@ girl .
it turns out he just wanted to st@@ le the front in@@ ables .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ os say it .
so this is allows us to do again as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had with the mes@@ fe trick .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
every single harvard as@@ now auto@@ matically assu@@ part in a lifetime time fund .
as an interpre@@ of a piece of music , i i first only have the written gra@@ des .
a chromo@@ some , by the way is just a piece of chemical material .
he had a poten@@ tially li@@ -@@ dangerous disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
well , today , our environment starts for the very first time , to respond to us .
at the now , in this world , we &apos;re that that data is a cur@@ se .
we need to make the consequences , and we get better pre@@ pre@@ are ourselves .
and people say in the back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see this right . &quot;
he asked me what the introdu@@ of these bal@@ la was for me .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they are also repres@@ ented in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
democracy grew grow , but at the same time the science grew in .
and i promis@@ ed to come back to tell you how the machine works .
and with every trial , the kids immedi@@ ate feedback feedback what works and what doesn &apos;t .
some of you might think , &quot; this &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
i then say with my own words , what might be written between this sc@@ ol@@ work .
we do it . as rational ally are as as we value intelle@@ ct .
so films were of the to to bring images and stories together . that would fit together .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the court room ? &quot;
how can i teach my mistakes on them so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
it &apos;s much better year . it &apos;s on the bran@@ ing .
that &apos;s not at all like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel .
i would cle@@ an@@ up my arm and show that there are no wo@@ unds .
they had sold this for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
and if we do this for ra@@ w data , why not also for content itself ?
because at some point , i had to say myself , &quot; what what do to do here ?
and we got the brief to design a building to door of the exp@@ o .
the king of si@@ am got al@@ umin@@ um be@@ ste@@ ck .
and players players always willing to work hard when they &apos;re getting the right task .
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ which one you want to use .
this is not electr@@ on microscop@@ graph a regul@@ regular microscop@@ graph .
and in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ company with green green bought the country .
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a of un@@ certain@@ ty .
and i &apos;m afraid to ed much more things that nobody one going to see .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which there are many birds for this birds .
and after two , three days , it realized that she &apos;s never going to to a@@ wa@@ ken@@ again .
we were &apos;t five five people then to re@@ build one around around society .
here you need a little lo@@ gic , but also have the position to lie .
co2 war@@ ms the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die in@@ conven@@ tional mis@@ ors .
we all know what &apos;s good about , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
and then it goes back back , and then it &apos;s &apos;s gets seen .
that &apos;s to the power of hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s doing fast everywhere .
so we &apos;re about to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
that means , we don &apos;t have to control the people , to be be prob@@ least bad .
this map is growing and den@@ wing and ser@@ ori@@ dance in the rest of the book .
and so they really wonder@@ vely about prepared the future civil rights movement .
you can also try this in words like like ven@@ ven@@ or or for@@ re@@ ction or something .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of fore@@ forest that was amazing .
he was a a child child , and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
in your mind : ti@@ me@@ frame and the ability of this really truly into life ?
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our he@@ arts .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why me that was an amazing thing .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning of our actions in the histor@@ ical context .
but even , in my ma@@ le@@ age species sometimes rock this thing up .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , and they recognize &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
and these two worl@@ ds are just ban@@ together , new and old thinking .
here comes this lo@@ gic in this , yeah , in this de@@ u@@ unding speech .
and a new city clo@@ ses some new opportunities for leaders .
tradition@@ ally , we in the environmental discussion , we &apos;re too many of many in the world .
i &apos;ll just go to to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do . . just do . &quot;
and now our fa@@ ei@@ king consciousness immediately feels , and you can do something .
but always , always the the idea that it &apos;s supposed to be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not stop@@ fabri@@ ous , material nature .
what about i ? ? what about the prin@@ it mail yp@@ le ?
in which the language language was sig@@ ned by entertain@@ level ran@@ g .
i wonder that you often have something very fundamental pleasure .
it &apos;s evolved through evolution in order to se@@ ek ct cont@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
this is a very gra@@ im@@ non ##AT##-##AT## @@ fish , categ@@ eg@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ sche@@ me .
you study the works that he com@@ pos@@ cted before and after .
it sta@@ sta@@ in blue because of the genes that we had ad@@ ded .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear field ; mod@@ ular y , liquid .
well , they couldn &apos;t make the piano , not econom@@ ically .
she saved saved my life , and my partner and i saved y@@ her .
one project that i just recently recently to a a gene gun .
if i start with a simple beginning , i learn like me to sele@@ se .
they grew car@@ meat e@@ cortex on what were basically we@@ t@@ lands .
but in the citizens connect is all open so anybody can see it .
if you think you &apos;re looking looking a good well it &apos;s almost safe like that .
and you &apos;re all -- lu@@ ck for moments is a fairly complicated process .
it was also the starting point of many dis@@ pu@@ ments in our family .
so i can go back a step , and i can jump directly to a specific se@@ ction .
now , all our objects , our environment , starting to us back .
and she believed that these were the top@@ ics that we have to care about .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 500 of the popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ties .
there are alone in the ama@@ zon area still six@@ hundred billion billion trees .
no fear , not ag@@ ush , child paraly@@ sis , p@@ p@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
it &apos;s not a wonder everybody thinks the world is worse worse and worse .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy on a car .
until in the 198@@ 0s , it was fis@@ hed in big style .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
but if it is where it &apos;s supposed to be imple@@ mented , something changes .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one ate something .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that will impro@@ ves government government work .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question whether we have the right to kill .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re both clu@@ sive or something .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i were not just killing out@@ ders with the spe@@ ar .
. you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft .
four times as many in the last 30 30 years in the previous previous 75 .
and more than anything else , are you just the best parents that they can possibly be ?
and i brought a project with you that i i want to imagine now .
that means you can see on the internet how you to return the nutri@@ ents .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is is pretty ht@@ tive .
i had something , your sister something . go , drink a be@@ er . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to say we should take from atom@@ atom@@ y at very very distance .
that &apos;s also reason why , for example , the conver@@ sten@@ cy into antibio@@ tics .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number are multi@@ pli@@ ing .
now , memor@@ memory self does more than remember and telling stories .
and that hard@@ ged these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
and often we we just run in a na@@ alle@@ and we had to re@@ ther us .
so what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
with your chemical chemical ster chemical , john -- how are you about that ?
we can give wi@@ ver@@ sity to a new meaning that goes beyond beyond e times .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could could out or re@@ prove ist .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ue is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we told her stories , and we as@@ red them that we were still with her .
imagine that anyone can give a little little don@@ ation to a stage .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ les that have specific function .
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the greatest skills of man .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even when it comes ds to our own best interests .
but they didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
as a result , the body develop@@ ves more the typical female female course .
she &apos;s near the mouth of gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
no f@@ ame , no honor , money . what do you do ?
these people represent several trillion trillion dollars flo@@ wing into the global economy .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s what ? now what drin@@ ks . &quot;
i looked looked through the uns@@ zz@@ wall , and saw it standing on the other side .
and someone who has such arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
bin laden &apos;s death kill@@ a a increasing risk risk risk .
well , i had a unique place in that day ; i was sitting at 1@@ d .
that is me , like doing the &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; face .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i &apos;m reading something new .
ad@@ ver@@ ties are for a change that we haven not been adap@@ ted yet .
this is in the second largest waste of america all entire country .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still running away every day .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our big creative cre@@ er .
because they &apos;ve already twice twice the cha@@ ir@@ man man .
so , fact , the music works works for me like the spo@@ ken language .
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m something super@@ gay .
i want to start with what i call offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
if you look at this in histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s does .
and it once have an interface , which is tially more intui@@ tive and much more natural .
you see in the middle the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um , the safe ti@@ ver .
if there is a ta@@ d in our family , it will go through the women .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , that &apos;s clear .
not the work itself . it used to be as dark as as e@@ h and ever .
so that , baby is the carbon posi@@ for all your life , right , from the very beginning .
okay , just a quick example of version of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
we need to find ways to address these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
and if we know know , maybe we can even draw wisdom wisdom from it .
so he did what every good develop@@ would would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
and if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s female about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
you &apos;ve recently seen cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phr@@ ences , thoughts .
i went up to it , and i started reali@@ noticed that these kids are actually actually pping a bit .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always always for more creativity .
we decided to do an experiment , and we sel@@ cho@@ se mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one by self .
and now i &apos;m still bine the filter with the b@@ l for a little more expression .
this would call , in engineering teams , a re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control system .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
we &apos;ve ank around from r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ment .
and in our western world , we &apos;ve always too stupid b to bring our ents back .
ne@@ x@@ pro@@ of law , st@@ ing laws of the continu@@ ity and so on .
he came on the table with a bright , almost low ##AT##-##AT## @@ white paint .
chri@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , or whatever .
the united states is one of the two biggest pollu@@ ty , along with china .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; for example , , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ melt , i brea@@ thing its pre@@ temporary atmosphere .
because because steve jobs once said you you need to do go ty to understand how it works .
at 17 , she became the second second woman a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat beat her .
this is one generation that grew up to see their voice for gran@@ ted .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destro@@ y the same time .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ te today , is ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
in there are are three of these these time , two are always wa@@ ited .
and basically , the bottom of the ocean came on de@@ ck , and it got thro@@ wn back .
but if i could give this and and i could make f@@ f@@ ely , i would do it .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the forest of con@@ go .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions they took hour or more of their time .
here we see with film , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ ...
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
that means , all of our intelligence means that we want to be dun@@ mmer as trees .
and most people understand this , but they think that one is a other input &apos;s input .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , a huge bunch of money .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
a million people every year to ate la@@ tin america every year and migr@@ te to the united states .
on that island , that is the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ors .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
that was then fix@@ ed by the ancient society , and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
it &apos;s because that possibilities don &apos;t go back on the planet , they &apos;re going forward .
and they realized that the city is never thro@@ asing these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
and that radi@@ cally changing the interaction that we have with our environment outside .
so this is w@@ la@@ di@@ me t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin from tar@@ tu in tar@@ tu in est@@ a .
this is the can@@ chan@@ le us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
should i get married later ? ? should i have first kids , or make a career ? &quot;
it &apos;s a story with the open ##AT##-##AT## @@ ding , and it &apos;s able to decide how it evol@@ ve .
if you take cap@@ su@@ les , they are more effective than than p@@ lets of any shape .
okay , there &apos;s why to for this , and i think we know what the reasons they are .
but is it a hard thing about the movie or or a difficult thing for me ?
12 to 24 hours later , everything whole re@@ together together as it was .
all right , there &apos;s up at the front of st@@ , and that &apos;s a quick piece .
this is a player standing on on the edge of something called epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to take a few decades .
and the con@@ b of your team is more important than all l@@ or@@ be@@ ers in the world .
i think my personal vision vision is very simple expla@@ ining about this slide and your operation .
so despite despite that war@@ ning , i knew that anybody was going to buy nam@@ name rights .
it will not create a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality .
our language affec@@ ts our think and how we see the world and the people around us .
you particularly particularly kes him , because he has a tenden@@ pe for sin@@ cer@@ ity .
but one &apos;s the indi@@ na@@ ans they say , &quot; the plant is ks to us . &quot;
and there &apos;s a story from the woman of the bis@@ cho@@ fs of wor@@ che@@ ster .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ all of this back again .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
in the the spirit of the other self , the memor@@ &apos;s self , , you get a different story .
they were playing g@@ ce for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
there are these ancient ancient cu@@ be , out of she@@ ep ep . you know ?
so we &apos;ve got eyes at front , and now you think we see looking from beginning to back .
and it does par@@ tly with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even understand it yet .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all at@@ at@@ ers don &apos;t end with a re@@ rest .
so you know the theory theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes out of the healthy healthy and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
it &apos;s not about what is reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of roll@@ aster are you in ?
the brown brown is sort of the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
we tell the people , oh know , you don &apos;t have environmental consciousness in the south .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the are are , ma@@ on@@ ingly good ? &quot;
if you ask , the fortun@@ ck of memory , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
these are decisions that will have their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , , to to deal with .
our vo@@ cal see@@ ars to sing@@ , , our hands and feet to dan@@ cing .
i &apos;ve worked 11 years in the collective , which was a s@@ roots table .
so , i start up as st@@ ator much much more likely to behavior than they are .
we &apos;ve also something on the corner of this particular copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
so it was a curious , and i wanted sort of of get closer to the matter , that .
i think if you stop people from it , you get them closer to fail .
you want to make the decision right if it &apos;s for all forever , right ?
i allowed me to asked li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them .
now -- we can just ski@@ p that up -- i &apos;m just just going to ski@@ p the video ...
and i &apos;d like to introdu@@ my my island project , i that i &apos;m trying to introdu@@ to you .
in the an@@ den , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the drin@@ king water source for this city .
what you might be asking is : how is that ? why ? what about those ?
now , before we started today , i did had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and you also have to do it also and understand it to understand it and understand it .
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , ma grandmother . &apos;ll promise it . &quot;
and what are our values , and what what are our tar@@ pos@@ , , our foundation ?
and finally , i get programs programs that can perfectly sort store numbers .
they were there there febru@@ febru@@ ary , and it did a a lot last febru@@ ary .
but this &apos;s really what what &apos;s all about , and then i open my hand .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ loo@@ p .
now if i use the term mira@@ wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
you doesn &apos;t happen at all at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world in the last year .
that would be . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be beautiful .
in fact , you &apos;d have have to prove if there is such thing as free freedom .
our ancestors never never so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
because the set was a accu@@ act copy of the design plans of the ship .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us was great .
when you came in 100 ways , di@@ ri@@ n , one of them should have been perfect .
oh , you know that . ok . great . so we &apos;ve got few players here .
instead of sending them to the third world , let &apos;ll send them to ra@@ ra@@ u@@ es .
you can explain it in in a way , there &apos;s even more more behind it .
you bring a new idea in it , and you &apos;s how reaction respon@@ respond with a reaction .
nobody knew where the next life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed to find at this moment .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s right -- that &apos;s the question .
and now just a little little bit through my skin and and on the other side , that out .
these little dro@@ dro@@ let were in terms were the most primi@@ tive cell form .
i i want to take this idea a little further on what &apos;s a little crazy .
we can also switch two hundred kil@@ o@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics up onto the net .
there &apos;s on the de@@ po@@ nia , but otherwise else in the landscape , right ?
when it &apos;s fla@@ er@@ free , the student gets up the next difficult piece .
i repres@@ cate these kids who were sent@@ enced into very hard pun@@ ences .
we imagine ourselves epi@@ c vic@@ tory , and we give people the ways of achie@@ reach them .
and then , the next day you were going to play , and the next day , you would eat .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s going , very quickly , and that &apos;s com@@ el@@ ing .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t listen to , they &apos;s not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
they &apos;re talking , think about what it &apos;s going to look like , they ran@@ n around power .
and a lot of people me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion scre@@ points ? &quot;
they say who doesn &apos;t have sou@@ l , who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t cla@@ im at all .
so the second sentence is , if sound is right , he has no sou@@ l .
now we get a idea of the kinds of that are the most popular to wikipedia .
and i think some companies are only going to focus on one strength , rather than both of them .
just like the double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; it seem have come of the where .
and in fact , fol@@ fol@@ fol@@ min@@ ing data from stu@@ x@@ net is recor@@ ded before .
the rest of day day the night i had this na@@ ging feeling in my sto@@ mach .
it would be consci@@ ght@@ us , consci@@ ously and target people . &quot;
they can get them easily , yes , che@@ che@@ up , or get them to fall .
man 5 : brand ke cre@@ ced al@@ co@@ hol ent wri@@ ber@@ ling .
or so what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you thought you could have .
evolution pri@@ le@@ le@@ the the creatures best ada@@ pt to their environment .
i know they &apos;ve done that because half of americans do it every day .
and in fact , they should do . these are important important to answer questions .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was ex@@ r@@ ent .
and i &apos;d be happy , if ce@@ g was help to make that happen .
this is the is by pressure and print scri@@ writing with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
imagine the first piece : a man man &apos;s ns his life .
but with the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , this was this guy .
i said , &quot; how percentage of your food is chicken ? &quot;
these are real patients under@@ cting a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
seven million people left on pro@@ ven , or under an ex@@ ment .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of production cost and ru@@ h@@ m is no tra@@ ce .
so , o@@ .@@ k , ha@@ ha@@ at biology , you you kind to need material .
i don &apos;t try to be right ; i decide to be happy .
why do we prevent prevent people to get knowledge from something if it &apos;s true ?
it &apos;s what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
and we &apos;re starting bu@@ mp@@ ing the limit@@ ies of biological reality , and that of our imagination .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction en@@ risk the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
fro@@ sty the carbon man is a pleasure , fro@@ ily bur@@ p .
so it &apos;s &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically do@@ -@@ ble .
the other place that was very interested in urban@@ city is sing@@ apo@@ re .
we &apos;re close to the seas@@ on@@ ing , and we move to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent has now having have a negative ic@@ she@@ print .
no important deal , con@@ and@@ ed innovation was ever add@@ done without risk .
in the united states , , the institute for medicine is the number at 100,000 .
i &apos;d like to share with you three things i learned learned about myself that day .
what is the man@@ etes ? what the p@@ p@@ ar@@ stage are they right now ?
i had better . all of this choice made to have better .
that &apos;s what i think they are are less people p@@ in than they actually exist .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come an oil sc@@ tage .
what na@@ than@@ iel an@@ about , he music brought him back into a community of friends .
this &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good follo@@ wer for marketing . &quot;
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is a es@@ e that is made of ure ure nature .
and with a kind of flas@@ flas@@ h@@ light , we can see these virtual worl@@ ds to visible .
it &apos;s such a large molecule that we can see it it with the light microscop@@ e .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the state of humanity .
and then to my worst moments : : how could i make a sil@@ ly mistake ?
i could see it in her eyes , there was hor@@ ror , the life was the end .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where foreign commercial was been ned .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
and do you know easier about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
con@@ struc@@ tors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an i@@ ter@@ ative process .
the young man &apos;s father was identi@@ fied as the follo@@ wer of the t@@ lam@@ lam@@ .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , you put this crazy brief ? &quot;
it &apos;s because of what 17@@ 7@@ 6 to the the unding unding fa@@ thers .
these wir@@ es condu@@ ct 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ gers when the machine runs on high ##AT##-##AT## @@ performance .
this is a project which with the name of photo@@ syn@@ th , really really conne@@ two two different technologies to each other .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of st@@ ils all 8@@ 8 minutes to earth &apos;s surface .
con@@ cre@@ te blocks were very quickly became the most under@@ zed building unit in the world .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consu@@ me as we are in the world .
think of this as the sequ@@ el of work by ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ers at virtual earth .
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a a song by whit@@ ney hou@@ ston .
they don &apos;t right right on their own facts . &apos; d@@ fe@@ t , they don &apos;t .
the next generation of graphi@@ graphic space space of already been working a lot more with behavior .
now this brand , the quant@@ quality m sta@@ dium , sta@@ ples center ...
and we we did , and we gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
i negoti@@ with inv@@ e@@ stors , i went looking for new animals .
the only ele@@ ction was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
he said , &quot; om@@ a tells everybody grand@@ children that you &apos;re special . &quot;
i love this picture , because it &apos;s somebody else else room room room , and that &apos;s his room .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 0,000 , 50@@ 0,000 children per year in the developing world .
and that &apos;s f@@ tively , good for that sci@@ en@@ science fi@@ ction role .
so with this information , we realized that there are lots of in@@ effici@@ cies in the system .
so what we see here is a typical death diagra@@ m at age .
under@@ for for exactly one week is all i did in my su@@ it@@ case .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our our water has no inv@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
but now , the biggest force that will us to a world of und@@ plus .
if you take them , you turn diseases back , horri@@ ble diseases , and that &apos;s &apos;s happening .
like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ved a little tox@@ in bottle .
so , they don &apos;t avoid food , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
in israel , you say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re to save the earth .
mu@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ run simply simply means the power station runs to keep the frequ@@ ency .
we then formed a team , a great great cre@@ w , and we started with this .
so we have to look look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all do@@ main of human possibilities .
a big machine , a cool , ted ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took on a few hundred million years .
it &apos;s true , we have huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
and if you think they &apos;re &apos;t look good in something , you &apos;re going to be right .
he makes a stat@@ ement about living now now , and maybe about things to things slowly .
there are some sign fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where i actually have to reach .
it might seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te block@@ cks .
you can put a switch switch in between , and so you &apos;ve created a little di@@ mmer .
these organisms can be dri@@ ed ed ed , and they can even live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
are you something that &apos;s a bit quie@@ , more reser@@ ve , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant .
the work of interpre@@ ter begins like like a theater theater director .
it liked swe@@ et and p@@ ure like taking a bi@@ te off the ocean .
and i fly with a little robo@@ robot stuff through the hall@@ ars of the ship .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
on the left hand side you see the sculp@@ points that different different cap@@ cted impres@@ sions .
we want to put every single interaction in the world into into a consu@@ modi@@ finished stone .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem be the same , but almost almost the same same .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
so here you have to du@@ p the i@@ pad and rele@@ out the fire@@ flies .
and i said that it would take take about as long as for the ken ken language .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be divi@@ ded into two la@@ ins .
we &apos;re ir@@ onic about it , to small leadership about it , &quot; progress . &quot;
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i say , but i ely you can tell it whether you like it or not .
he kept looking looking through the window and he could hear all the to@@ hu@@ w@@ abo@@ h@@ u .
there &apos;s a variety of ways in magic to connect connect the world and technology .
spa@@ tial thinking is deeply sely connected to how how we understand a much of our environment .
people are always asking me , because what are you actually to do , in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ p ?
we never have those emotions , when we play games , in games , they just don &apos;t exist .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between individual and nature .
and so the te@@ sti@@ cles give on the fe@@ tal stage dium te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
or even du@@ ce@@ end of of these cities , or hundreds hundreds of all over the world ?
i really only be@@ for it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
in this period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different hom@@ ini@@ ds .
it &apos;s a blog where you &apos;re how how building the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
so we don &apos;t really have to worry that other goals might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
if you want to support by 100 percent , you need an incredible wonderful battery .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the the co2 out of this material material ends up in the atmosphere .
they say , &quot; no , tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and i sent it away .
so unfortunately , the biggest number number of goals for such attac@@ ks not in the middle east .
you might ask , why would somebody actually take time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ##AT##-##AT## @@ challenge ?
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept ed on .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction like anti@@ bodies that attac@@ attack human .
and because you burn the 99 percent , the cost profi@@ le is much better .
we &apos;re growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
90 percent of our start were we@@ ak@@ ges , other animals connected to the cause .
re@@ ession ession . stand@@ still . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
a school uni@@ form form up to the kno@@ gs , because it had to reach six years .
over time , we &apos;re focus on the big animals and the sea are the big fish .
one effect , the parado@@ x@@ ically , is that instead liber@@ free paraly@@ paraly@@ .
so let me introdu@@ you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or human universal load car@@ rier .
not allowed to call it that , it would be a a little poli@@ tically cor@@ rect .
i sorry . when you get na@@ low , look away , don &apos;t look out .
and to my du@@ ck , i had written him not only , i i sent to the dis@@ court .
then she said , &quot; you have to give me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
thank you for hun@@ ting us an@@ ther@@ ing an@@ fear . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
so , we don &apos;t need to be man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we we can be climate positive .
and if you do that , you eventually eventually with a cy@@ ber mass mass destruction .
so his ma@@ mach is now , &quot; why isn &apos;t the going to talk about the research ? &quot;
and my love of the ocean st@@ ps , with the same inten@@ sity it e@@ h and ever .
when each of them born in this room , 6@@ 6@@ ,000 languages were ken on the earth .
this &apos;s b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ te side ni@@ er@@ hyper@@ bubble bubble .
and instead of economic st@@ st@@ lock , i see one of the greatest economic sh@@ m of history .
in the summer of 2009 hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ under a sever@@ cious com@@ sive break@@ crisis .
one about all highly appreci@@ ded kin@@ dness : somebody had even bought a few shoes .
so you &apos;re actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you can put online .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
so what we have to do at a global level is to create a new system .
the family that fear of his life took away all the the weapons and the tools .
we bran@@ de from a common ance@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ e about about six or eight million years ago .
at that point , i was the car@@ di@@ ological layer on the car@@ di@@ ological service .
so he seems , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it it kind to feel propor@@ on@@ ate .
and you really have to be tough tough , , but i think it works .
no , not because i &apos;m a more ous ous and good ek .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might es@@ ce some of the nu@@ an@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
a woman in germany e@@ about six com@@ ma three kil@@ ogra@@ ms in their lifetime .
this fact is often put in a context of the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in , i gave her medicine to to take the pressure from heart .
do you want butt@@ ons ons or cr@@ bs ? ? stone , or ac@@ id ?
and so -- it says , &quot; this box ow@@ gs ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
i think , here in the ted group , there are lots that already already commit@@ ted in there .
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , even much further .
so you don &apos;t have to give classi@@ cal music because they don &apos;t play instrument .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or we should should .
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; aug@@ ust .
she made me so sed that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the . then she let me go .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need bu@@ re@@ re@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
when i met her as a kid , she came up to me and embra@@ g me .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ st@@ ded this aspe@@ ct in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but in tly , i was wanted to immer@@ down for the real w@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
in this case , we &apos;ve got to give full gas gas and get a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
what we &apos;re trying at national geographic is that we believe politicians politicians never achieve anything .
but , when writing is about i &apos;ve &apos;ve about this recently , and i &apos;m myself , why ?
so , we pre@@ tend it &apos;s actually impossible impossible without live a sou@@ l .
there are technical concep@@ ts , like the aug@@ mented reality , the exten@@ mented reality .
although i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
it &apos;s not possible that everything will evol@@ forever and forever as fast as it now .
what it characteri@@ cts a story are fro@@ unds , meaning@@ ful moments and the end .
one of the ads ers of the coal industry was christ@@ christ@@ mas .
early early after@@ noon , people here and there who are phone calls and moving .
so we &apos;re supposed to percei@@ of them as something that is to be present for our lives .
yes , kids are in@@ in@@ in@@ curious , or should should be curious , designers too .
or c , because they agre@@ ed that they &apos;re un@@ compe@@ able .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with visual points .
a story that argu@@ es with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people people to get knowledge from that .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that are actually di@@ di@@ gest dna .
of course , you can only that if you man@@ man@@ in any way , man@@ here .
in an emergen@@ cy class , i &apos;ve looked at a blind am@@ tion twice twice .
now now these choices choices different in the number of choices that you you make a decision per decision .
they make a more worse decisions -- worse financial and poor medical decisions .
it &apos;s there in skin ell and rich@@ in in america and it helps growing our economy .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange exchange your dna .
but if something like this happens happening , it changes the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative conditions .
he &apos;s aff@@ able , he &apos;s cious , and they stay in wa@@ ge and bread .
it turns co2 into me@@ me@@ than@@ e to use using hydro@@ gen as energy source .
it means to create something that is to to cking the potential out .
we can get them to do things they they thought they couldn &apos;t .
but primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very alive .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on foot , the place is un@@ known .
we &apos;ve tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ it down to the mini@@ um components .
and so i started playing around around , and i realized that something was happening there .
well , they were also super -@@ tech and took red con@@ com@@ hen@@ sive planning .
and that &apos;s the beauty thing about creating things that are being used and inter@@ acting with the people .
it &apos;s faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s the reason it seems to be so conf@@ using .
i talk more about about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
finally , the positive alternative is mix@@ es with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
sounds crazy . but this goes back back again that your own imagination can create a reality .
it &apos;s something in , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
at every place where you throw away , from , yes , again , again create the possibilities of life .
in 195@@ 7 , making five mis@@ sion@@ sion ary tried and made a profound er@@ ror .
it &apos;s about the values put in that words and how we constru@@ ct these values .
and if we have an energy over@@ plus , we &apos;ll also have water in ab@@ und@@ ance .
this woman then com@@ pla@@ ined , the portra@@ it certainly &apos;t &apos;t similar to her .
because if the wine is there and the person is there , then i open it .
and we think we were prote@@ cting the environment , if we &apos;re a little bit less har@@ m@@ ful .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
here , for example , is a study we did in a magazine process .
the fourth thing is that the story for us , it is a place of information information .
their own photos are sig@@ ged by meta@@ data that has enter@@ to another different person .
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 wo@@ kes up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
and these particles are water , while our our cloud is a cloud of sc@@ ctions .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
it &apos;s sure for sense to be less har@@ m@@ ful in terms of oil consumption .
but it &apos;s very alien for la@@ as , what we musi@@ musi@@ cians do with our musical language .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limited it .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that that magic and magic magic have re@@ re@@ placed by machines .
but even if you turn these attac@@ ks , it still rema@@ ins something something technical .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to be afraid of op@@ opportunities that might sc@@ sc@@ them .
we know exactly where all the mon@@ m ms machines are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
i &apos;ve done all these films these docum@@ ent@@ ary films i &apos;ve &apos;ve done for a very small audience .
what happened next is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
and what when you want to see van go@@ gh did created this ma@@ ster@@ piece piece ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart out of this code .
the reason for that is it requires a lot of trust to play play with with with game .
then the next steps , like like , and so on , la@@ sted less than a million years .
at mid@@ night , the kil@@ k came and said he he have to close the co@@ g .
green is copy , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is input and orange is c@@ able .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the time takes at 21 billion hours of play a week .
you can make your opini@@ on on every chan@@ nel at every time , and they do .
and if their employees can can &apos;t stick apart , they can &apos;t their custom@@ ers . &quot;
well , by 7@@ 17 , you have more dreams , but not significant memor@@ ies .
one year ago or so , i read a study that really really ble@@ b@@ wn me off .
so not more zer@@ and ones ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , it &apos;s a metaphor .
and so we started the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
you &apos;re already a building site , and you already mention this area for the second city .
what &apos;s interesting today is the re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control systems begin to appear in our lives .
but one of them might be with lu@@ ck , put two numbers into the right order .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ 17@@ , , was the second time with 1@@ 14 , was appro@@ ved by a voice .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
here are the four things i found . first , ur@@ cy optimis@@ m .
and i think we of all are part of the creation of of whatever comes next .
i think this success pressure pressure has wi@@ wi@@ ated our artists over the last 500 years .
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and so you want to have ni@@ x as well .
and if we showed that to show people , we can drive a change of behavior forward .
and my little star@@ star@@ tu@@ p would us to to conser@@ vation environment by it ...
at the co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we climate change as a serious ger for our business .
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
and it &apos;s a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
you can go to the website , load all design designs and make it yourself .
that &apos;s like this , then means means we &apos;re in in here right the now in a transition .
so i want to say there were a number of choices , but it all not a question of choice .
one thing , as you already know , has already resol@@ ved , there &apos;s a lot of r@@ ors .
we know an development process is not when it gets too complicated .
just to give you a sense of what the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
but that also brings des back to the point point , when when are the going to become more intui@@ tive ?
as as you talked about the smaller movies , we are a brand challenge as a brand .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s very comfortable comfortable .
we set set a little cooking directly right the business business business .
the first steps of the story that i told you you took took a billion years a piece .
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
so , come back to those two creatures that have been been zed at the beginning of the talk .
so in the last few , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and let them work with city out@@ ces .
so here we see a young female and a male in a pur@@ su@@ ture game .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ cted , called prop@@ he@@ t .
extremely important , now now is &apos;s extremely important and much , much , much more important in the future .
so when i travel@@ ed and go visit those muse@@ ums , i started to learn a lot .
this is the work very smart people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
and then suddenly you you would what it would like if they couldn &apos;t talk to your own language .
and over a hour and and a half to two hours began to feel better .
down there , the gra@@ y box , and on the top there is the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gen .
and even when we think about the future we think of our future future usually as an experience .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
they &apos;re find crazy examples all over the world , people how people optimi@@ ze the system and re@@ fin@@ ate .
i think that we need to do something about a changing , important piece of medical culture .
now , let should tell you what happened happened one night when all the sensor@@ s stopped working .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is a one , two , three , four , four , five .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but various times , different light .
all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
and then you would ask : how happy are the e@@ ye@@ ks in the life of survi@@ living itself ?
and it would be best , if it made several , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
instead of breaking breaking heads over down , they just burn it . a great thing .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we ended up in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
that inclu@@ des all the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
i don &apos;t want the past , and i don &apos;t be because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
the second story is a different concept , the alter@@ ble changing w@@ ill sp@@ wide .
this leads to star@@ vation die . it leads to inse@@ curity . it leads to ri@@ ots .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course tomorrow never comes .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was yes how to get to hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
so i sho@@ ted that and made this other film about the large ship that under@@ lower .
we put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king lot outside the hospital .
and i &apos;ve come to the core that that new new will off@@ people people new opportunities .
but we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do do we need to get down to zero ?
and this often a this problem when you look at the long li@@ sts all these these ds .
and now i connect the fil@@ ters with the dru@@ m so that i can ally drive the effect .
that is one of the explan@@ ations given for the domin@@ ance of memory self .
and those of you who interest it can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ challen@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
and my view , the mo@@ s@@ sad is involved , but the driving driving force is not israel .
now , last year , on this site of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , were more than 250 different ways .
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be du@@ mmer as trees , right ?
they don &apos;t have to be engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
so for example he would work exactly as well -- in a power plant , or in a car factory .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
when countries get in in places like cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , you shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
have you already done a two or third opini@@ on , , as you say beautiful now ?
i had introduced a kind of travel@@ y@@ of the penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .

she saved my life by leaving me use the teacher teacher room the toi@@ let .
as a young law@@ yer t i &apos;ve had the great privi@@ lege to meet p@@ ink par@@ ks .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an se@@ or@@ ing , fascinating and terri@@ fying possibility .
and that leads you a less happiness with results , even though the results are good .
con@@ or@@ ing the great great break@@ through@@ s , is that the biggest thing you know of ?
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you are a better che@@ f than i ever going to be .
my life is really extra@@ ordin@@ arily bl@@ essed by working on some couple of some amazing projects .
you can have me as farmers , or lea@@ ther , but no one ever vot@@ cted farmers .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to to tag a piece piece of tree mr@@ i photogra@@ pher@@ s .
she said , &quot; the first thing , you will love love mama mama love . &quot;
what does it mean to vi@@ br@@ te and not at the same object ?
sometimes when i wanted to spend time her , it was hard to get their attention .
and after that , we looked at what case that people were more of buying a glass of mar@@ al@@ er .
and i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
and none of these stories are very assem@@ ate or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
these are si@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ countries that control the 40 percent of the oil oil lies .
i &apos;m is not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form .
so what i do now is i &apos;m changing the order of which the decisions appear .
oh , by the way , these fl@@ amin@@ gos shouldn &apos;t be there in the place .
every second every day , our senses cap@@ cap@@ a much more information than our brain can ever process than our brain .
these soli@@ sts were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional professional , and they were fantastic .
in short , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer at the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
that is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only 40 years old .
we &apos;re che@@ aper as the same system , when the same price incre@@ up five percent per year .
you you &apos;t usually no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle cle to a particular date .
think about it that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
that did this for already a lot more friend@@ ly , but it &apos;s , of course , , much better .
we could only as am@@ or@@ p@@ he m@@ oll@@ us it through the global oceans .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
i i want to talk now about what that could be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
please look at the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , where it &apos;s in the water line .
they were all the f@@ f@@ at a time , even the je@@ ly was called k@@ f@@ a .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t a protein , and scientists don and scientists , to &apos;re build this in it .
she came from school school one day , she &apos;s teacher , and she said about a student .
well , there are all kinds of gam@@ -@@ play solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring very much .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he built a camera of the players .
so , what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led people , or a powerful person ?
it has nothing to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ , pri@@ ani@@ cation .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a physi@@ cian , but you can still do more .
you &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- pro@@ sts , in an opini@@ on , or through your audience .
what i have to say all the time when i get crazy about this is , don no afraid .
it be we we know glob@@ ally , and acc@@ gre@@ faster faster and faster and better .
as i said one of the biggest biggest right now -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- -- started his beginning of youtube .
still , we &apos;re to the story@@ telling as information facili@@ ation we &apos;re very , very highly ar@@ re@@ sted .

that is , we looked looking for for first to find the largest bat@@ battery in the world .

look it carefully , this is the , clean cooking technology .
i &apos;d like to talk talking to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail .
the sum@@ mary mary has a short re@@ spe@@ tion and a symbol on for the area it comes from .
you &apos;ve got to have them to dinner , not not nutri@@ ent the@@ ft .

this super@@ computer is called &quot; global im@@ mortality , sensi@@ sensitive system , &quot; of course .
you usually to get out if you call in your city of 3@@ 11 .
they say that all things that will display up there , follow a life cycle .
when i cho@@ out a a job as an adult , it was a fil@@ fil@@ making .
so to get a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it wal@@ ws from me me , out to , to planning .
when did you last heard about a who who was talking about a a of es@@ es@@ failure about a fal@@ es@@ ke ?
over time , it changes . it &apos;s changing because for people , for their actions are their actions .
and it makes me excited in ard to consi@@ der@@ ations about democracy .
so we met in dec@@ ember in the bo@@ ate@@ om of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
the sister , who did that bra@@ ve action , was taken to to an education camp .
and course , you need biological materials , and you also also need tools , , and then that &apos;s a lab .
in my school , i was going to bus to school , an hour an hour every day .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , mess@@ tter@@ and conf@@ used idea in my head .
this o@@ co@@ ction of all over the world leads to to a dra@@ matic increase tion in fir@@ es .
it felt if it came , because it would cause the earth qua@@ in under their feet .
there are such profound tan@@ vel@@ ing lessons for us , about the the nature of pro@@ sion and success .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed how tom was ken in the free sky , and i tried it .
we get so good at whatever to do , like the most important people in the world .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and hand@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ ap@@ p , called &quot; citizens connect .
the gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es that you &apos;re seeing here , , these are re@@ time control systems .
that means we &apos;re losing in the ground about five thousand times more than re@@ re@@ ated .
now , why do we draw books in the technology on se@@ mi@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
i think the reason for this is we realize that that anything is under@@ going .
you see on a li@@ like that the li@@ er doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and that is that b@@ w@@ l students have been trained to come to find a right plan , ok .
beyond the cities , , pull all this sort of tra@@ ths and push ge into objects objects of everyday life .
and what it does is it causes people to walk into the business and to ask this question .
because i &apos;ve experienced it in 197@@ 197@@ 1 i studied a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
i think the gen@@ geni@@ re , the style i have is probably , dark glamour .
and then he said three words -- the l@@ l@@ tion@@ l@@ less words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
and this is what led us think about the following project that i &apos;ll show you now .
this ch@@ art shows what it looked like when when the video was popular for the first time last summer .
a second circle already starting to associ@@ ate ate or associ@@ ate of simil@@ blan@@ ity .
it &apos;s a photograph i was just recor@@ last last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
it was all about the trying to understand the world and to out the limit@@ ations of the possible .
and then he ad@@ in , really really quite emotional , that has ru@@ ined the whole experience .
this is a reali@@ alist case . this is a copy from the guar@@ di@@ an .
when i first saw her , i pulled brought them out of her mother &apos;s gut . &quot;
he got in@@ contra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and re@@ covered a few days later .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m about is the one you you your inner@@ first sick .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living itself and the memory self .
and our approach was to just say , o@@ oh , that you don &apos;t have to do it .
technology is not the way that which you to describe something that somebody is doing under those ei@@ al@@ les .
and i would invi@@ te everyone to look with it , and try to try yourself something .
people are about recogni@@ zing they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how getting government government into crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
we took little robots that we built , wra@@ a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
then they just just use what is the sun and the wind in in where they live .
if i asked you to to count the great world religi@@ ons , what would you say ?
because the transi@@ transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using ing when you &apos;re in the the middle .
two few sh@@ ells ghts for school , every to cover the holes in the other .
that &apos;s going to get the patient suff@@ , but just a little less and much less than it did .
women , like men , do in our bodies have something what something called an ad@@ ren@@ al@@ no@@ ses .
they call this a &quot; stre@@ aming trials &quot; in the united states , what we call this &quot; tracking . &quot;
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans at the bri@@ ck@@ y , there &apos;s no exc@@ uses for mistakes .
well , we &apos;re em@@ it@@ out a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
also , by bee@@ tho@@ ven knows he heard more than he had become dea@@ f .
with so many op@@ tions tions you can choose , people makes a very very hard to even decide .
it &apos;s a means with which the sou@@ l of a given culture find access to the material world .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
and the old ada@@ ge &quot; when it flo@@ wers , demand , &quot; goes very true .
woman : 8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val hits sk@@ at@@ al point k except the day .
in a fra@@ ction a second , i lost every feeling and motion under my be@@ ket .
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
in the united states , you start to measure the experience in the population .
but what i would be re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
and they &apos;ve found that a average ce@@ o is bus@@ on the week with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks the week .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the de@@ ck with it .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver ver allo@@ ck@@ watch .
and i got a bad sun@@ burn ned , and i was convinced i actually didn &apos;t stem from there .
and the si@@ ft@@ ables is an example of a new generation of aid tools for manipu@@ ating digital data .
that we &apos;re not fully designed as humans as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
well , in efficiency efficiency , the e , energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
just tell me a little about how connected to to your thoughts and feelings about you .
i think that can be changed by re@@ re@@ re@@ combin@@ ed vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
in california was seen a 40 percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ w@@ gles of the si@@ er@@ ra .
but su@@ k@@ c@@ essi@@ ve just w the scri@@ pt as a primary medium , in content .
in 2007 , i i decided that we should re ##AT##-##AT## @@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development .
i think the big picture picture makes sense , if you break it into a of billi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ dollar steps .
and i turn around and i look at this older man . i had no idea who he is .
more than anything , anything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
and he knew them , he was able to contribu@@ mit tional information to contribu@@ on them .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done i want to share with you through a short video .
and because it is , there &apos;s a basic human ni@@ ty to respect the law .
capital , chemistry and machines are are standing in it , ben@@ an , and it &apos;s never produced a really good thing to eat .
so , the com@@ pos@@ ers are on ted on us to re ##AT##-##AT## @@ rein@@ vent pieces .
at the end of the planet , the arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
do we need to bring emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try to keep the temperature of earth ently ?
a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone everybody today : is this idea for you totally fine ?
first , a ball game in bon@@ o@@ o way -- and i don &apos;t think of of foot@@ ball .
because sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a liber@@ ating resources .
but anyway , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for your life .
we now have the chance to build a big robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
so scientists scientists came to the that her@@ od@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story actually actually true .
i find it &apos;s really hard for us to say that we are the final product of evolution .
and these , although none of them any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single day of day .
i question , can &apos;t you sing , a because they think they can &apos;t sing ?
we ad@@ our nor@@ standards to the new level and don &apos;t even remember what was there .
so the am@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our ri@@ ger dete@@ ctor .
i feel that we have to , when as people scre@@ people , , people to encoura@@ people to take risks .
and i &apos;ve noticed a of things that make epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ happen in online worl@@ ds .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al ##AT##-##AT## @@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
so what is it for an idea about thinking in hon@@ dur@@ as building a whole new city ?
so let &apos;s look at factor factor in and let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
and so the film is going to explore this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in e@@ ternal , forever ?
and the a students are te@@ up in a sever@@ ly , the better teachers and so on .
in the good in evil , and perhaps earlier than you may think , these decisions will be on us .
and over the course eight or nine days , they they went to it .
the doctor says , a has these benefits and both risks , and b has those benefits and risks .
that is , this first impres@@ sion occur@@ in a ra@@ dly fast fast speed , in way we percei@@ ve things .
it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less care@@ ful .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both put together in the notion of happiness .
in the 197@@ 0s -- rather in the early &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe produced a of development projects .
they don &apos;t want to pick the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ res@@ sing .
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that makes people people &apos;s imagination ?
and that ev@@ ening i was lying in bed and thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
your skin cells are us@@ eless eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
you never get pleas@@ ant surprising , because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , home@@ home .
let &apos;s first consider the reality that people are today , in certain cultures make decisions about their off@@ spring .
yes , you already feel , when you &apos;re ter at that point . something is not right .
one of the most important things that we have to think about this is that government is not the same thing as politics .
it creates a very strong image in the head . that &apos;s much stron@@ ger than white p@@ ill .
we work with universi@@ ties throughout sub ##AT##-##AT## @@ sahar@@ an africa and invited them to learn social social re@@ designs .
what &apos;s interesting is is that at that time that humans were simul@@ ously media produ@@ cers and medium itself .
every own music is made platform if you &apos;re always com@@ ated from the outside with music .
well , let &apos;s go where we need to reach , and then we talk about the inter@@ step .
that could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; it puts it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
so many people currently we have in the world who we spend at least one hour a day playing online games .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non ##AT##-##AT## @@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
we sto@@ , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
how many of you saw the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m &apos;s super@@ computer wat@@ son , on &quot; risk ? &quot;
and the reality of that expression takes es all , , and moved , inspired and united us .
and if you have hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , then that &apos;s like an self ##AT##-##AT## @@ susta@@ ing system .
and then if you do good images , the out@@ come can be pretty , and it can be pretty reali@@ stic .
this ch@@ is really ... i &apos;m going to show you you another time once we have a proje@@ ctor .
the importance is the creativity that is in the internet culture of tech@@ ies and ge@@ e@@ ks .
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want sna@@ ke , slightly vely or wide wide ?
i &apos;m just going to show you few examples -- again , with the idea of cing and power@@ power our environment .
but that &apos;s exactly we we &apos;re working on using the same approach@@ es for developing v@@ cin@@ es .
and dr. p@@ . was always fly very bun@@ ed and had was just done for work with kids .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that needs needs to to be involved involved in film art . &quot;
all these photos are connected together and it comes up something something bigger than the sum of the parts .
i even come into one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum in new york .
it didn &apos;t really liked my intuition , and it just because i don &apos;t often play with so often .
the real meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; ro@@ ined in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
she was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of very sla@@ very formed her world view formed very much .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in anything .
and that &apos;s happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with with my legs , and even all of this experiences .
and that &apos;s for us humans that is always something intui@@ tive if i have to think a little bit about that could .
and these students don &apos;t it , so they go out and read their school work under the street .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private vi@@ vi@@ reser@@ ves ves all over europe .
in fact , we thought the end here , but we &apos;ve tried to the process a little bit .
i worked with with people with d@@ war@@ m -- so people who were smaller than than usual .
when something like that happened , people knew what that was and they called it on his name .
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we are currently living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
but we know , when we say that , the social relationships are very dist@@ very sensitive .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become stran@@ alien to us , and has has nothing to do with reality .
and listen , everybody has a right to their opini@@ ; even their right to their right of progress .
you have to go up , by the fire , and you have to get some some shoes . &quot;
well , unfortunately , we tend more see this face in real life , when we face difficult problems .
climate mas@@ ke@@ p@@ tics : do you have a or or sent@@ ences for you to you may convince you ?
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er then then and what you might mean for for him today .
by the way , year about hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electrical power are going to on the same basis to built in the world .
and the child plays playing after a memor@@ memor@@ pause , instead before a red now a blue flo@@ wer .
within a year , you run an el@@ ction , and then you start with the commercial fish fishing .
man 2 : the brand ke i am is , i would say , not fly .
i myself learned him from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic the p@@ fa@@ le fin@@ der in the 197@@ 0s .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a a farmer just can easily can ze it .
is this something that you can actually te to , because now you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
we need digital security systems , where a human machine oper@@ ator can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so we thought that we could start to write write a whole new chap@@ ter in the region of mo@@ bility .
to do that , don don &apos;t look at the a@@ cultural industrial model for the future .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend like it isn &apos;t .
but at that time when several multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ ell@@ ular organisms showed up , things began to change .
and i think that our current pun@@ ish@@ doesn doesn doesn &apos;t serve anybody .
1@@ 4 : bad car@@ s . an@@ 5 : : dangerous cross e@@ lan@@ ships .
it allows us to produce things with a much greater complexity than it allow the normal metho@@ ds to produce .
and the basic lesson , i think is that construction is actually a commit@@ ting sport .
there will be this little blood pressure prin@@ uring device you you atta@@ yourself to an iphone or something .
no , not because because we already enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just eding .
but in the end of the out that i was take space scientist with us in the deep sea .
over the last three decades , crimin@@ crime rate in america has dec@@ emp@@ ly .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to having chicken of fish ? &quot;
or better , how can we create conditions that every community to feed itself ?
so here , i think , the art and the film can perhaps fill in the gap , well well the simu@@ lations .
and they did these special structures that did nothing else but but process@@ process information within the organis@@ m .
now look what happened happening that day , just obser@@ ving the activity that happens in the network .
i spend most of my my with people people in on@@ ining , prison or death cells .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another &apos;s until you &apos;ve hit your first million .
add that bu@@ zz@@ er for a more extra effect and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and i think that is what we &apos;re seeing in this explo@@ explo@@ cing cur@@ ve .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french are and the japanese have done something in the direction .
so an example , the most fin@@ ant we we known of of this type of communic@@ ations communication is human language .
you need this lie to lie a lie to main@@ ve ve a self ##AT##-##AT## @@ de@@ ception .
but now there &apos;s a bra@@ ve new solution to free us from this mis@@ position .
you you an up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that blood blood blood in wh@@ star@@ ales ?
so , it &apos;s about creating a large foot@@ print that &apos;s becoming a we@@ t@@ land .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i going to show you where the d@@ al@@ tin@@ tin@@ is .
he had understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone with it are two different things .
so three very difficult problems that might perhaps be solu@@ ble and therefore you have to work on .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before will connect ge global communication .
the categ@@ ories do have to say the sele@@ choose , not to one which des the sele@@ choice .
we want to preser@@ ve things that are gone or things that are no longer the things that they were .
fri@@ day , one universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ le@@ tes fit everything .
it was about a method with which parents can figure out what are the right public schools for your children .
and one reason is this enormous heat heat warm heat green@@ land from the north .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it can only one with hope .
whether it &apos;s a lo@@ location of a mind , or a bunch of in@@ her@@ z , it is ir@@ relevant .
the day before that event , i called the head of the public work for the company .
but before i get to the subject of my talk , , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
the second largest wide group that we &apos;re we to obser@@ ve today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
if you know something about the government technology , you &apos;ll know that it &apos;s &apos;t usually going to walk .
instead of pul@@ hing the water out , they used the can@@ els to pull the water back in .
now this may sounds ab@@ sur@@ d for you , so far you &apos;ve never been thought about new cities .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering ti@@ suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is given in the pig@@ s over over the d components to ex@@ extra ment .
they hear a lot of talking about quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says everything &apos;s connected to everything .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they worth so much more than it costs them to build .
and the color sounds and paint and sha@@ ti@@ des you might remember &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this &apos;s been mentioned so much today .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and and create create a symbol .
when you turn the lights on , it looks the same . so the like we &apos;ve seen before .
they do it because they can follow the pain@@ ved white line on the land , a@@ 9@@ 2 .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of 21 app@@ s that wrote the lo@@ lo@@ ws the last year .
so i &apos;ve started thinking about what it is , what these games do for us .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ##AT##-##AT## @@ challenge is doing is it helps them identify them the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
imagine front of the screen could simply appear into different forma@@ ts or nu@@ zes , different different resol@@ ution .
and if you want to have ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to take up on the need@@ le .
if they &apos;re surro@@ unded by each one , you can also notice it , and you can a little bit nervous .
now , about now with the virtu@@ ality that is really the most natural thing in the world .
i teach some fully fully smart students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i once did .
that &apos;s because the government is like a wi@@ ther ocean , and it politics politics are the top 15@@ c@@ ches .
and after , when i thought it , i decided to shift negative energy from my life .
if paul talks a public listen@@ ction , he cannot say without without med guar@@ gu@@ man .

think about it : we &apos;ve got four@@ -@@ letter code : a , c c , g and t .
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photos of photos that you &apos;ve actually recor@@ ded .

that &apos;s going to think , in the next decade or two be part of the national statistics .

they help help the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ twice by con@@ gress .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , and versus citizens .
in this case , i worked with people who have body guys that challen@@ oned social nor@@ ms .
as we as@@ out , i had this feeling of dying , human being is not terri@@ fying .
we want to fight pre@@ bi@@ tion and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system .
at the end of a day , i cooking a huge po@@ t sou@@ p p that shared shared .
you &apos;ve probably heard about level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
for us and it &apos;s a game fundamental for eng@@ aging of relationships and the nur@@ tion of toler@@ ance .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
this is the first object you can see that was in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
now they might think that the whole thing break down of categ@@ ories would would really happy like me .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children the natural world with their technology .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ players . 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ ably good &quot; something . &quot;
but these article were worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i i figured it out .
what would you do that they go ot because you think you were there forever ?
one is the energy den@@ sity that these technologies are gener@@ dra@@ matically lower than power plants .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today that is less .
a a set , or a was@@ hing machine , just use it , and they don &apos;t use it .
we don &apos;t encoura@@ ge people to eat this kind of ro@@ dic@@ dic@@ ed stuff , like mani@@ sa@@ ok .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the view that the fish knows something .
we just wanted to know , , what about a normal , stin@@ normal electro@@ chemical battery ?
in a sense sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ e is the core heart of our global climate system .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people as same way , life is not teeth teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
i thought , &quot; make the camera out of &quot; would mean that we wanted to do a back@@ ground conversation .
if you put an ex@@ e@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , they become signific@@ antly better .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other things called es@@ es@@ ol@@ ar has the great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
so for example , the 16@@ 4 pen ks very out of this code ; you can you can &apos;t over@@ it over .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order that this information pres@@ ented ented .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s not what the individual and the family decide .
that means , 15 po@@ und wild fish is necessary to get a po@@ und weight tun@@ a .
our cities have , , in the last few years , were ar@@ ar@@ pped ed with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
no , they didn &apos;t broken the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
when these ima@@ points fall fall down , you can write on it , you can lab@@ te patterns , pain@@ , images , text .
i believe that you have somehow moved to no@@ stal@@ stal@@ a , to wonder wonder wonder .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and sou@@ i@@ ing itself to us who can afford .
and what is what we can read in the daily newspaper every day , you find find in that third sentence .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape image , and the bottom part was mani@@ pul@@ ated .
and sometimes when something comes over ted , it does a sense , and force otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
or are we meant to become something else -- something that might even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
they don &apos;t fight this battle we &apos;re all fighting , so who &apos;s to speak ; they &apos;re all speak .
one example of this from a different area , mon@@ et et pain@@ ted the se@@ ro@@ x x once .
because obviously , an animal that there was very common common , once r@@ ar@@ ely before it &apos;s dying .
but interesting is the unique sound of of song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
i really hope that we together play major games , each together to live a another century on this planet .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
and i want to just you to proto@@ col@@ l that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
and the prepar@@ ation for that was enormous . we had to do was build c@@ ameras and appar@@ lights , and all all kinds of things .
you have to make the sound of the wind , b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information , of the genome x ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
and the next piece of le is about four women in three generations , to create a new life .
we &apos;ve up at the point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we did .
so , just to you picture , i &apos;m going to out out so you can see what you get .
now , i &apos;m opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think of something in the way that this will happen .
and as part of that they created an concept that was about an@@ ic common@@ ali@@ ties .
and the argument , here would that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly mil@@ , but they &apos;re unbe@@ per@@ able .
players love to become part of a@@ we to spac@@ ing mis@@ sions of planet@@ planet@@ tude .
i thought it was like giving us our our clo@@ ches and dre@@ aming c@@ ameras .
in in china , a a post@@ co@@ is still still of hon@@ e@@ ey po@@ ples , , if you say , right ?
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i there there probably no male male s to their treatment .
you see , there are two countries that have almost 70 70 percent of phosp@@ hor@@ us in the world .
i was the second volunte@@ er at the ho@@ edge , , so i had a pretty good opportunity to it .
it actually took a few years beginning with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
something as profound as our identity identity is now a question of choice as this slide should show .
how can we keep them any longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fro@@ fish .
but what &apos;s interesting about vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , what we have here is a generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ players .
and the side i@@ ors ces making and@@ ro@@ gens that are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
by sha@@ king the si@@ in@@ ers and and them next to each other , he can interact the characters ...
you can &apos;t &apos;t ph@@ ph@@ ze how essential to that factor for people &apos;s quality of life .
the next puzz@@ le piece is how a boat is out in the early wn red light at sea .
and that &apos;s a great concep@@ tual model of the world as long as you &apos;re a part physi@@ c@@ ist .
either &quot; fl@@ oral fusion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; you &apos;re going to have a choice .
as a child , i had tree colle@@ ctions , st@@ cks , ki@@ les and sh@@ ells .
and in reality , when we fall fail , when we run counter ob@@ stac@@ les we often feel different .
for her , the life set her a mission : the es@@ cape of of family family and a new life in australia .
and these arch@@ ic models are heard that we have basically ally natural relationship of virtu@@ ality .
the recent day they left her walking -- woman pressure ter , a woman , mother and a grandmother .
and so you can see animals animals right next next to a 500 degrees centi@@ us that they can survive there .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from the myster@@ y science theater was a person to make a jo@@ ke about twitter .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting the evidence den , you see the magni@@ fic@@ of of lie .
already today , po@@ ed in some flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e out of water .
these are both strong under@@ fu@@ tions because we don &apos;t really look at the problem in much as we should be .
so order us understand each other also , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
fur@@ ther@@ , despite their log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic lost on the left side , it it up@@ up .
so , or or mis@@ us@@ , a@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fis@@ her@@ ds , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m america america &apos;s ily child &apos;s book writer .
an@@ 2 : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . an@@ : .@@ c. spra@@ y of police .
she somehow managed to find the time to have english and it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
now re@@ produce produce all rema@@ rema@@ rema@@ who who best produced the numbers .
his mother was lo@@ cked , as a ish@@ ment for -- cri@@ crime to be weal@@ thy .
i i just make this more up and more , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better man@@ able .
we have to prevent people to get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
but not true , we have seven percent in europe and our web is physi@@ cally is the european .
it sounds sounds very spac@@ yed and it sounds like like sci@@ science fi@@ ction , i know .
in this in our country there for children life have life in life without without condi@@ tional pun@@ le@@ ment .
here it &apos;s needed to pull what we understand under the tically cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness , over over again .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
now let &apos;s &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can anti@@ ci@@ te the development .
this is almost to limited with total security -- probably for the fish , definitely , definitely for us .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really really stri@@ uring out of the so@@ cks .
and that &apos;s half of the ab@@ water problems in the world caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ lege , e@@ e@@ ase ty , of direct desire .
the idea of this is obviously not just to over@@ at the machine oper@@ ators in the control room .
so we could make the world very simple very stupid , maybe maybe hundreds of hundreds of new cities .
now , when i was a ne@@ ul@@ ing at college , i had my first bi@@ biology class .
these gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es don &apos;t run windows software ; they &apos;re based on completely different technology .
we say , &quot; computers , gener@@ please please a hundred million of random cho@@ sen sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
but we know from this study that you have reach reach the need@@ le when it &apos;s to go to the thing .
we know that we work a human nature opti@@ mal work when we get hard , significant work .
maybe rever@@ to an common understanding the relationship about the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the creativity .
we now now almost an infin@@ ite choice choices , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and i think the most important thing is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
i &apos;ve brought you one example here by the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
make the ways that are easy to use and begin to hu@@ hu@@ g@@ g patients on the team .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e , and he will be the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ wearing ...
why not the fast muscle fi@@ bers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to go .
and so , of interest in in , in in this technology , i just just into further going this .
in high school once once once told a student that brian gold@@ man was learn to learn for a flo@@ wers test .
so when we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to look for for negative news .
so my really really this is that when you see something that &apos;s impossible , make it possible .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with the actual of to be st@@ ages .
this question was so profound that that we decided to explore explore the answer and and si@@ in@@ ables .
if somebody asked asked you to describe your brand identity , their brand person@@ ality , , how would it ?
all this takes the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
and like many people , i thought that the government was was about vot@@ ing people in an office .
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by ti@@ wing wing the speed at one direction or other .
i &apos;m going to take myself to a statistics , which i hope that most of you may have heard heard before .
so there &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s ates ates us , is our imagination .
something is called gest@@ ling law or or ell@@ based psychology , which is also affec@@ ts us in perception .
and we might even know what wood wood we &apos;re cut from when we &apos;re are te@@ cked .
a third phr@@ ase that will immediately emer@@ up with people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
and so by the way it &apos;s for 500 years since since as i have to say , very very successful introdu@@ ction .
for example , we developed an ice cre@@ ice pac@@ aging , which is at room temperature flu@@ id .
most of the mass car@@ cer@@ in in country country &apos;t really really happened in the class of violent crime .
so for me , photograph@@ y seemed seemed more to be around at the right place at the right time .
and that sa@@ dness really really himself in one thought , which is that i only one thing i wish .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have have made by hand .
so you also lots of people , and look at at there , and , because you can see you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the orig@@ cent of man .
do you say there &apos;s some negative effects that have have to do with the clou@@ ds that make things different ?
well , so you see , in all cases , nobody has to be a inten@@ ful can@@ di@@ date .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great , you don &apos;t need any fuel -- you have some dis@@ advan@@ ks .
you don &apos;t sit around and turns w@@ around . there &apos;s always very important to important to do .
unfortunately , they aren in open@@ ach , but maybe they can help help for a a little time the fr@@ ance .
this is like the de@@ ad@@ line that showed us the environmental models we must main@@ tain .
this cre@@ end@@ er will pro@@ suggest to invest the money in more security forces and security .
police off@@ ic@@ ers come in and de@@ pu@@ ty state law@@ yers and office workers .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish s@@ pt to half its size .
i &apos;ve confi@@ red that they don &apos;t bi@@ te . in in fact , they won &apos;t even even leave the glass .
you can change the cells in your body , , but what if you could change the cells in your des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts ?
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ a@@ , who made me crazy ts not no fan@@ at all .
that &apos;s great . the ro@@ man didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
nothing wal@@ vels into my sle@@ ev@@ ve or come out it , no tri@@ cking y , and you can study everything .
this is also the entertain@@ ment value of this talk , so i hope that p@@ l has you enjoy it .
because in this context , we are beginning to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
in addition , a study done with ce@@ os recently , where they week obser@@ ving the ce@@ os .
you can see it &apos;s kind of colum@@ colum@@ n often called a wander@@ ing wave wave re@@ actor .
now , mor@@ gan , the name of transpar@@ ency this : now what happened to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve long sed that point at the sele@@ ction improve our public good .
important for the cre@@ ages , they usually have it in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great st@@ based laws .
40 percent of all people in the world get half their fresh water , from this mel@@ h@@ water .
we built an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
i remem@@ ded last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow somehow people liked that .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future , is exactly the opposite opposite .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be poor@@ poor@@ poor@@ ful when you &apos;re wearing light red pants .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells and came back , and they killed e@@ . col@@ i .
do we use these decisions to make society that is better better , that is more successful , that &apos;s more friend@@ er ?
and this really pi@@ es es these ideas to draw these limit@@ limit@@ ations to the that we have on the screen .
i mean , each of us could spend five times as much on our energy energy without changing your lifest@@ yle .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put these little pieces pieces and and cor@@ rect er@@ r@@ ors .
that means that we have a common st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to put into the dis@@ and and i do this this crazy case .
so we have the memory self and and the living itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
i ad@@ ore my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
if i went to a room -- as i &apos;m right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i would only get face face two years later when we moved to california .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
unfortunately , it &apos;s all whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and you &apos;ve been ly mentioned .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling bling to think that our species has has exi@@ around for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
i got another gift gift , which is look into the future , and come back and live differently .
and therefore , for music &apos;s learning , the music language you you need at least as long as the spo@@ ken language .
we &apos;ve managed to give up about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
so we over@@ at our brains , , because our brain just doesn &apos;t quite much that it doesn &apos;t really sense .
because it &apos;s often people come , you can &apos;t do it us@@ -@@ friend@@ to it , so anybody anybody to to deal with it .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my physical therapy .
now , i &apos;d ever opened opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it i would have spent another hour .
people are la@@ ying in their faith , and it &apos;s so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t liber@@ ash free .
here we see seeing again again , again this dies@@ ot@@ e , again , the whole one , single ag@@ gre@@ gate .
and we we inst@@ all an evolutionary process in the machine which is happening in the mi@@ -@@ art section .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
so in other words , the future has dra@@ hr@@ ed a year after a year since i am in the world .
if you surro@@ mit yourself the right people , they won not only understand it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
evolution is all about the exten@@ ing the genome to to the next generation , adap@@ i@@ zation and survival generation , after generation .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor actor that which seems a little hard but they say that about us .
so doing like things -- -- you know , re@@ minds people of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
well , just to conclu@@ de , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
if we think about biological biological , or re@@ replace any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge .
first of sound very ban@@ al , but it &apos;s really exciting when you get closer to it .
in vision : now , i sort of acting with the object , i can zo@@ om out , i zo@@ om in .
they push the choice decision -- -- push it , even even if it comes to their own best interest .
this is a game with words that which is kind of a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and a g@@ g@@ gle .
if you break the gold fish glass so everything is possible , you &apos;ll reduce happiness .
it feels what i want to do i want to go , and then increase my strength and resili@@ ence .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ v@@ ine di@@ ener@@ spirit of creativity creativity creativity &quot; dam@@ s dis@@ h .
what should we begin with the fact fact that we &apos;re dist@@ different from from them by few nu@@ cle@@ ti@@ ties ?
in the rich world have diseases that bar@@ dly millions of us thre@@ at@@ at@@ ed us just one generation .
who knows when the film will come out , we we might look like a hor@@ de of vol@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and said , &quot; we &apos;s oil go out . &quot;
here we see a very fundamental service . is there have light at home so you can read the home@@ work ?
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see it she be be over it in the next century .
and that will getting worse and pretty soon soon will will die it again , because that &apos;s just one of the numbers .
because if we could find that , we would never have have before a human potential .
we &apos;re not going to be to to answer me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going &apos;s happening happening at the moment .
sur@@ ely , i would never go to an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p . i seemed to be quite un@@ likely .
there &apos;s actually a corner , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about about that the wir@@ wir@@ ess@@ plan on .
the fo@@ unding unding fa@@ thers in my view , were the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
vac@@ cin@@ , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are success of the scientific method .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted over 400 billion ro@@ were produced -- or 75 ro@@ cks for every person on the planet .
they played a cu@@ ce game , and the se@@ ers were allowed to break an ep@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
that would have have been without the the environment , , but it matters so more important .
and to win , the device has got to diagno@@ se better diagno@@ than a team of highly quali@@ fied doctors .
we need market r@@ ce , co2 ta@@ ing , ca@@ p &amp; trade , something that creates an price signal .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration and tell tell you some interesting things that happened since the laun@@ ch .
the man &apos;s grand@@ father wasn not dre@@ of of the arc@@ tic night or the wing stor@@ m .
he has no piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t a pen , he has no c@@ ta@@ pe recor@@ der .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ ze the two kinds of yourself , you &apos;ll end up doing very different things .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t po@@ p ##AT##-##AT## @@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense anymore -- that shouldn &apos;t be not necessary .
as peter told us , they not only create the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , what we &apos;re most most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;ll find , for that there are such more predi@@ cted , obviously , you can &apos;t prove to this .
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , try try and er@@ ror turns turns to be be meaning@@ less .
my heart ra@@ hed , i was di@@ ek while i was trying to put what was front of me .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor will tell you : we could do a , or we could do b .
but once and again , very rare , something something happened , and one of the tors was actually became sc@@ ou@@ dent .
for example instance , for instance , on the tr@@ arb@@ is 20 percent of the amount of g@@ ash now wind@@ mil@@ els .
but here &apos;s it : if if you get the evidence to accept this evidence , we &apos;re not good at it .
the first example assu@@ mes what what many of you know and appreci@@ some some of you , very few don &apos;t need need at all .
so so these get these words that that we keep using using in the language of political cor@@ cor@@ rect speech , and over again .
so these tenden@@ kes to survive longer and they increas@@ ed the larger mass .
but these concep@@ ts of cy@@ ber age , who are us to bring kinds of cap@@ abilities to re@@ discover back abilities again .
and the main lesson that i think we have learned is that they &apos;re really different .
his his cause to write the piece becomes increasingly and more and more to my personal cause to playing it .
so now i &apos;m in one of my favorite images , har@@ est@@ wor@@ from pie@@ bre@@ bre@@ l in the met .
i want to explain you something with this ism today , or or you approach something that is un@@ consci@@ ously probably familiar with .
but there are no clu@@ bs that we can look around , where you &apos;re learning how to do fire .
at that moment it was like a film director director had asked a change in in the change .
that &apos;s just as if if i said , you ke your child , you just b@@ ep three rather than five times .
it turns out that it meant in fact , &quot; we don &apos;t want anything to do with your movie . &quot;
recently i spoke spoke to the oil industry , and they said they pre@@ li@@ sted this model .
when profess@@ ors get curious , then they frequ@@ often pus@@ m in in research se@@ me@@ ster like this .
and we think we &apos;ll be the first fu@@ els of the fourth generation and that in about 18 months .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um that helps them make their jum@@ ps .
happens is the machine age , and it &apos;s the book , and happens is this is the phot@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
and it &apos;s about solving it in a play@@ ful ful , original way , solving a problem .
no , the lies i talk about , who has to do with pre@@ fa@@ ve themselves .
so , we were able to connect the little digital head head to ro@@ house control .
so the neurons are the the process@@ ed process@@ ing at@@ us that we have these cell communities built .
obviously &apos;s obviously , with a virus is very simple , it &apos;s much complicated to deal with bacteria .
one method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used very l@@ recently is evolution itself .
so , imagine you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel like ?
we had a team of boston from fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston to do the the code for america .
so , by and and large , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we &apos;ve actually deci@@ ined ing what the goal is .
so the idea is that we actually invol@@ engage people in in which they &apos;re doing things together .
there are such dis@@ versi@@ ated things like these these gene@@ tically changing plants on the bran@@ ers .
they lie , they che@@ at , they &apos;re conf@@ used and produce really dr@@ dr@@ ely shapes .
you can take ahead and create their own museum -- from all these pictures you can create their own colle@@ ction .
because the ground just , the mo@@ s@@ ses die off and and the wind and the the the water was@@ was@@ ting the soil away .
well , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually usually something that you &apos;ll found because you dro@@ pped it somewhere .
so , just as a citizens are in the of to agre@@ yourself with these scientific technologies .
it &apos;s about how happy , or de@@ ate the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go the future ; you can &apos;t stay here here and now .
at home in new york , i &apos;m head of the development department of a non@@ organization called ro@@ bin hood .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow y to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough enough to solve world &apos;s most ur@@ gent world problems .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends ends , when you put out the out .
and yes , the discussion is about the question of how far can you take a piece of the future there .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down in 20 , how you know from a docum@@ ent@@ aries .
i spent spent a lot of my life life to trying to be myself and ada@@ pt at the same time .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which would really have to go back in cy@@ cy@@ cles .
if anybody had built a 2.@@ in@@ ch high construction , he he would have taken the price back home .
and every time it shared it , chemicals chemicals spre@@ ted into un@@ equal quanti@@ ties .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when when the tri@@ ger was hit .
the result is that i no no wher@@ where i &apos;m treated , as if i re@@ ted the mis@@ line .
but not only that -- they they mer@@ ge and connect connect with the universe and other devices out there .
they &apos;ve sha@@ ped the demo@@ cs the earth in a way that that no war war ever done .
and , my interest in photograph@@ y started when i was first received my first digital camera , when was was 15 years old .
for these non ##AT##-##AT## @@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ it became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics just became another material .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall .
so what can three billion billion growing , healthy , educ@@ ated productive members of the human community get us ?
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that is in@@ indian c but is also very ti@@ m@@ temporary .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and it seemed something pre@@ fer@@ , with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , this re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control systems .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you are taken in by the mind . and how you be damage to you ?

they are a little bit technical technical , and they &apos;s a little business business on along , and there &apos;s &apos;s something like this , very , on questions .
i think the fact that it &apos;s hard hard the fact that we take beyond beyond our bor@@ ders is value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .

only if they then you another example , so if she immediately makes a ha@@ y@@ y@@ ack bigger bigger , it doesn &apos;t need san@@ sense , and doesn &apos;t need nothing to it .
we we trust that to making time with us that the rules are main@@ tain@@ ed , we have the same goal , and re@@ stay there to the end of the game .
do you have a perspective -- don &apos;t want to look angle perspective &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do do you know how this &apos;s going to turn ve ?

i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a good d@@ d@@ bird of of not the last last you to want for on fish ? &quot;
i needed someone who could inv@@ ade inside my head , someone who could really help me what &apos;s called &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
the fact is , if you could only reduce the price from one thing , the redu@@ duc@@ ing would be most effective in energy by anywhere .
we found one for them , we took them , and we car@@ care care them , , and we eight ed her family family , because it necessary .
but a li@@ p pen pen , even in this ill@@ um@@ ting , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s , really effective , right ?
you &apos;ve seen it with the flu this ; we &apos;re always a year back behind it and having a dollar dollar too little when it &apos;s to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
this re@@ cked our attention , and we started a lab project , where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and looked at this con@@ struc@@ ct .
and i just believe mit that the capacity in in the 30 years we have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical stor@@ ories around the world .
why ? this picture descri@@ bes much exactly why i think that games are so vi@@ tal to the survival of the human species in future . seriously .
and when i close my hand hand the same happens happen by turning back , , be hidden by this movement that the fing@@ finger is moving again .
adap@@ adap@@ tive technologies have been able me to since since since , to to to ski@@ , , clim@@ bing , and even with the hands of bi@@ ke .
all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es changed changed -- when we read the genetic code , that was what we trans@@ finished .
and then we looked for ti@@ bers and data data , and tried to bring them together to the real world -- invol@@ to the potential tar@@ gets in the real world .
i don &apos;t know if this brought the greatest ju@@ ju@@ ble , or this as somebody vis@@ the google side , and came the the it like the starting page .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , col@@ um@@ ist the los angeles times , one day walking through the streets in the central angeles in los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble the different head and shoul@@ ders species of 26 down to 15 , they experienced an increase in sal@@ ces by 10 percent .
and super@@ this , you don &apos;t tell his teacher that you like to put flo@@ walls somewhere and be happy when the fire blo@@ ws up after@@ wards .
the biggest single single factor for global warming , next to for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent is is burning fossil fu@@ els .
later i found discovered that , something about the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have thought about the challenge of in hon@@ dur@@ as re@@ form .
and of course , there are teams that have lot more ta@@ -@@ da &quot; training , and the best of the the school gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and the idea of music and then bring it about another possibility of have to sound across an instrument , sound .
because they went running the midd@@ man man , they went by agen@@ cies , and said that maybe ag@@ ent@@ cies didn &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
his completely non ##AT##-##AT## @@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in cru@@ t@@ ches , the send signals signals back to our bo@@ ard computer that &apos;s atta@@ ched here on your back .
because at that point an individual -- learning is now over the time period the an individual fes@@ pan an individual organis@@ m , rather than this evolutionary amount of time .
we bring new technologies to new attention , but for progress progress it requires technology and laws . and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
one is , how s@@ oth she lost -- in good like bad times , war or peace , peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high ##AT##-##AT## @@ jun@@ c@@ ture .
and yes , much of what was said today is very really ched to me because many , many beautiful expres@@ sions about that i also lived through .
since then in the 40 40 years who have up up now , i spent spent about 0,000 hours under@@ water water : 500 hours of those in sub@@ ch@@ bo@@ ots .
because if all things are made of and all these particles follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics don &apos;t &apos;t just just follow follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
you can see that when we can create this kind of vie@@ in which we can go rate through images and make this experience of the times of resol@@ ution .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ged in ke@@ ker@@ su@@ at@@ at@@ si@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
and if you &apos;re on vac@@ ation and someone someone collapse , it &apos;s be your own relationship , or anyone else you can find an a@@ ed .
that &apos;s going to be a energy li@@ rier that then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas gas you you or sch , that &apos;s going to be it .
so what is it an for to con@@ ins@@ sting that each family has a choice between several cities that ting compe@@ competition around new resi@@ dents ?
i got big in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ an ##AT##-##AT## @@ american se@@ , who was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ arch@@ in , and this matri@@ ch matri@@ arch@@ ch was my grandmother .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and that will be a key factor -- -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ it@@ by per unit of of energy .
what i know is that it really really important to think about the idea that the u.s. is leads to the ideas about questions of democracy .
i go to the tion prison prison and i visit a mand@@ ent who wants to be 13 or 14 years old that is supposed to be with trial as an adult adult .
even though the choose the choose choose , not nothing me what pre@@ ences in in ior inter@@ inter@@ ors , it &apos;s still still des me to choose to choose .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l , 199@@ 9 , complete control over an of of that that something greater than california and texas combin@@ ed .
because if you read just reading about it , from secon@@ x ##AT##-##AT## @@ liter@@ ature , it &apos;s not the same as once you did done or seen it yourself .
in &apos;s way you you can see no time &apos;t anything anything , , as long as i press here , nothing can go into my sle@@ ve or get out .
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you you be hear about any doctor &apos;s doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your be@@ mistakes .
i &apos;m not saying that that &apos;s the answer all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s life consi@@ sts sts of more than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
i call it ne@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and led and decided from us as an individual , in the decisions that we make .
because , we is , through this new kind of us@@ ability , so the natural counter@@ surface faces , for , five times faster on average average on our target .
and he said , &quot; no , just if if you &apos;re to the social society and you have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , then you can actually do that .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth worth ta@@ ands to some really known br@@ ands .
the importance is that a single person a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took up a stand@@ view t with a large audience and by acceler@@ ating the process .
we were later told that if it would go through the normal n@@ els , it would taken over two years and it would have cost over two million dollars .
if i look in the next decade , i &apos;m sure with two things : that we can imag@@ imag@@ in@@ vable future , and that we can can play all kinds of games .
and if everything goes well , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , then actually , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a is this technology will be be glob@@ ally in in 20@@ 20@@ 6 countries the entire planet .
or if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet bet where i re@@ form lots of work , you &apos;re going to to see the ug@@ ly the ug@@ ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
so if a single at@@ om can the same time in two different places , can be this piece metal in two different places , why not &apos;t you ?
when i invi@@ you back for dinner and say , yeah , there &apos;s a tab@@ p@@ with with open ds and and some glass of it .
when i found the main man , he had in a very serious conversation with the ow@@ ner ner , who who had one of the worst days of their life .
but to be fair -- the group of the chemi@@ sts did not given cent@@ over the call of al@@ co@@ hol swe@@ ent man@@ ic depres@@ san@@ people .
we are light years of getting people better , and our goal is simply that we have a chance to survive a long enough to survive that long it possibly do that . . thank you very much .
some of these oil dro@@ ks con@@ had a particular con@@ combin@@ ation of chemicals that that would them them to it integra@@ integra@@ te other chemicals from the outside , and to grow it .
it got quite sil@@ . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it is impossible that we will ever respond on@@ again to the syste@@ syste@@ matic of people .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine that i wo@@ ke up one morning and going to the living room . all my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
what i want to do is a movie around product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the the movie fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
today , i don &apos;t , maybe a guy of up in la@@ gos in this plane , and just going to los angeles , at the moment , he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
she doesn &apos;t do that very scientific -- she &apos;s a c@@ c@@ of coffee or te@@ a , and she ask the patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; well , how does it work ?
i got three or four years ago in the middle of the night a call from this teacher , a m@@ po@@ post who said , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see her .
so let &apos;s go back that about 2.@@ 5 billion years , the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ stone bla@@ um@@ p with a lot of of con@@ flo@@ ating chemicals .
we created a wrong se ad with very high ##AT##-##AT## @@ resol@@ resol@@ ution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we we ad@@ ad@@ ded extra content in the it .
so we &apos;re not a maker maker , but we &apos;re define ourselves as a company that &apos;s in the theme of battery and the the web web and everything in between .
but i was the lucky lucky to meet very early , at three of of to meet , , and so that was that i was was on his clas@@ ses .
through impro@@ vement , i try , and studying studying consum@@ ers ers i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the basic elements .
and none of these plants , we &apos;ve now built over hundreds and th in the the last ent@@ 20 years , none of those plants have ever s@@ ab@@ ot@@ ed .
when people have free , then each of us to do about the things that ma@@ ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ our public and nobody to decide for us .
imagine , for example , imagine if your wife is sad , if you were p@@ set is@@ ed you , and you come with five 50 ro@@ ses .
compared to the entire amount of of climate shif@@ ting materials in in the atmosphere , it might double that dou@@ double if we over@@ move to this critical point .
this is an image of a large , new city town that made built in south korea , big as city bo@@ st@@ ons .
the red fact that links all of them is our depen@@ dence on carb@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ based fu@@ els like fil@@ ty and foreign oil .
she &apos;s one of the re@@ ples here here by this great event , and she asked me i i wanted a talk talk here , and my idea a@@ by my idea .
it won &apos;t be be very long time the reality is that there will be 1,000 1,000 human genom@@ es es , and it &apos;s going to be more and increasingly available to all of all .
then woman woman car@@ r said forward to me , put a finger on my face and said said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
after a time of refle@@ ction , i seems that i that to be able to continue to write to design design a kind of prote@@ ging ing psych@@ ological struc@@ ct .
it also leaves me in exciting about the great product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to get me to be involved in involved .
they say , &quot; okay , that doesn &apos;t &apos;t be so stupid stupid and it cho@@ ps itself itself off , just to entertain@@ us us for us for a few minutes . &quot;
a place where the women lead the cep@@ ters , with sex sex hell@@ o , &apos; and the game determin@@ es day -- where fun is a serious matter .
if we did it on a written size of 10 without without di@@ stances , it would write it 14@@ 2 pages , just to print print that genetic code .
so i would be more better about all whole thing , if somehow somehow we could show that everyday objects are are are follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
and the machines that do something like this are actually pretty expensive that you buy to commercial cially , the che@@ ap@@ est ones go out on four thousand euro@@ s .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical thing , but not the normal , and you you really want to know this poor , gra@@ y person , if there really was them ?
these could be cu@@ ri@@ ar workers , or techni@@ cian , for example , to make sure the mel@@ ated a@@ ed is still in its spot .
and i realized that he ow@@ ned not only an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ di@@ c of music , but he also connected it to a clo@@ ght personal relationship .
and when we &apos;re facing with a body that &apos;s actually represents something very very different for us , we conf@@ conf@@ using used in terms of these categ@@ ori@@ zation .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so the computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , because c base in ber@@ lin was to was the first , nin@@ nin@@ th hundred of five ad@@ 9@@ y .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the death of our our body is in the same moment as the sexual re@@ production .
we believe because we have taught us so that the real question is is : did did deser@@ a human being to die for a at@@ cri@@ mes ?
if you keep keep using the standard choice of choo@@ decision , that means that you &apos;re over@@ wh@@ el@@ , the most test , i lose lose .

mar@@ ia , whereas , can &apos;t in the states , the same right that same that ein@@ ein@@ rich in all states , and and that ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
now there are some of us who sort in way , that i , when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really mean different possibilities of being being .
and i can say that from the reason we now live in an epidemic of fear as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
now , for those of us that the government gave up , it &apos;s time time we think thinking about the world we want to leave our children .
and it worked . again we had created something ma@@ gical , the impact in the audience was was the same , but we &apos;ve come the film , movie a little bit more money .
what you find is that the people who go from the many them to the few it@@ that always do over and and again choose the standard choice .
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate is you need to have a website with a tt@@ ps , with ss@@ s ##AT##-##AT## @@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted it , for example , g@@ mail .
a person who was opened do@@ ors for me was my pe@@ di@@ at@@ cian at at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in del@@ aware .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty from this real out@@ , , the mirror can &apos;t lie , come out of that true background .
the process is f@@ ds itself , and so so i think , auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something increase rein@@ ases its rate of change .
but you know what you would be to in in in these a@@ part@@ ments and their surro@@ und@@ regi@@ ous laws to to avoid c@@ and and stra@@ cted from ex@@ gra@@ ture .
you can be moved by your hand , you can see each other , , you can capture their mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a radi@@ tat@@ ular reci@@ pi@@ ver .
we go through the same st@@ that have done through cell@@ ular organisms -- present the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ that how we capture onto data data , process@@ ing .
and then they get their pu@@ p@@ ills , they &apos;ve mp@@ pped front of their head , then they look look down and they wal@@ low up , and they start to tell their stories .
that might be to free a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant fire fire , , we@@ ed cr@@ , , turn a g@@ arb@@ can with a po@@ yl@@ bat@@ ch .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters will code about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there there &apos;s a single regu@@ ation for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
i think we would all understand the mo@@ od that woo@@ dy allen hit sed when he said , &quot; well &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach im@@ mortality through my work .
eight years ago i was at the media lab and i started this idea how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
she did a me@@ ga@@ watt watt and can produce this for six hours and that is the battery that we got sort of of simulation simulation field .
anyway , the part that was involved curi@@ osity and science . it it was it . it was an ad@@ vent@@ ; it was curi@@ osity . it was imagination .
there &apos;s a survi@@ vable self lives in the present , and knowing the present , is able to re@@ re@@ ve the past , but it basically has just the present .
and this is , yes , these are usually quite young people , but the only only that that un@@ you all of , is this fascin@@ ation about the technology .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;ll tell you you something , but i have to promise promise you don &apos;t do it further . &quot;
but before i show you what i have in i going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
patient b was suff@@ ered more suffering . . his gut refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain pain pain patient patient had patient b b , and more .
in the course of the film had over 500 companies that were up up and down@@ companies , and they said &quot; no , &quot; because they didn didn &apos;t want to be part of the project project .
so the things that make a picture look reali@@ stic , i think it the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday life .
and by the way , if you want to do , write down in germany germany , best best best by all the the wa@@ lar@@ treatment that &apos;s &apos;s in frank@@ fur@@ .

now , if i want just get bigger over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what , what if i look all with the bi@@ ke issue ? &quot;
so i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you want to build a new city , you start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als male co@@ ped , his brain was subje@@ posed to the typical male male the part of the hor@@ m@@ one spectrum .

in the next plan@@ table elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won won a rever@@ om whose program ga@@ both both v@@ and and promis@@ ed fa@@ ame .
so this &apos;s important is because you only only by looking at web@@ sites in this way you can look all the internet course of internet internet in the same way .
then all the fing@@ ers are in time and just like it moving in the gra@@ des , then sound sound out sound sound come in the like des like music .
first con@@ cre@@ te block blocks were made 18@@ 6@@ 8 and and from a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le from ement ement with cri@@ ures that fit together .

and this is a bio@@ curious , who also mentioned mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this yes , some kind of fol@@ fol@@ y school basically for molecular biology .
what if you could make the genetic changes to to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer alzheimer &apos;s , or elimin@@ duc@@ ing risk of risk or stro@@ ke ?
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes just , to repli@@ cate , d.@@ d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , frag@@ ments , so you can make them visible .
and starting from these networks of that have done the whole of popular popular , halt has evolved such a scene that i &apos;d like to to portra@@ it .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal sub@@ rup@@ tions of un@@ inten@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ ch is forced an out@@ come .
and in fact this is happened that we have responsibility for our memor@@ ies and over@@ la@@ shift our production of our individual memor@@ ies on ex@@ ternal media .
after you &apos;ve cho@@ cho@@ a piece piece to play , because you &apos;re very excited about this , you first to to research after the evolution of the com@@ position .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch docum@@ ents of a government government that &apos;s gives us data , and i understand understand that , i think that &apos;s what all of us do .
and of course , we hope , we we exp@@ spread a similar , and then also similar well inter@@ connected , so that you can get more more people people doing it .
i combin@@ ed it with my former pre@@ ference drawing draw but it was a little different , because when using the camera camera was the process more in planning .

we actually start from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology and we &apos;re to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by designing and designing and designing new life .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re involved in re@@ elimin@@ ating the dan@@ gers that only only when they put fire .
so we take something very complicated thing , we turn it into sound , , sequence of sound , and we produce something something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it turns out that if you can something something that specific specific feels feel , it &apos;s a very good tool tool to get people to save more .
so we &apos;re not only responsible to keep the people we love to protect f@@ ty be@@ ks , but we are are p@@ are them also to be well with being clearly .

because it makes just much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about in all about explain the completely crazy e cap@@ ri@@ ity of the creative process .
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s in a few days days and then spre@@ ading from rare is is sort of a star to the institution of the government .
what that means is , if you hit hit somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two ##AT##-##AT## @@ foot man how much would you know about his size ?

and i left the medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i knew memor@@ zed everything and i knew , , or at much as possible , as to complete li@@ ability as possible i could , that i to be imm@@ une about the er@@ mistakes mistakes er@@ mistakes .
and then i take take one step further into this natural inter@@ faces where i by ed , , by language , per touch , per gest@@ ure , by mouse and and cur@@ sor has to control things , then i &apos;m going to be even faster and even more immedi@@ ate .
carbon hl@@ evolution fle@@ ed the industrial revolution , even in the 20th century , there was a very pid fall in electricity , and therefore we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , climate climate , , climate plants , we can create modern materials , modern materials , and so many things .
we see this , when i st@@ things , then i can design them conf@@ using as on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ pp@@ , , or i can of it it a intui@@ tively tively tively way by by showing things .

so that is one effect . the other effect is that even we over@@ come over paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less happy with the result of the sele@@ than than if we had had had a opportunity to choose if we have less choices .
