just because of that .
thank you very much .
nice one .
thank you .
... yet .
that was us .
here it is .
i &apos;m tom .
yeah . okay .
you need time .
this is hard .
1.@@ 5 million .
this is not ...
it goes fast .
is that all ?
and he says ...
thank you guys .
we were poor .
from se@@ attle ...
music as language .
it &apos;s interesting .
after one week .
like twice over .
we love innovation .
that &apos;s wrong .
we know that .
ta@@ -@@ da !
a few less .
solar technology is ...
what does this mean ?
which is sing@@ ing .
oh , my god .
yes , hell@@ o .
what does it mean ?
go home to where ?
i can help you .
we &apos;re taking off .
it &apos;s a lot .
does that sound good ?
it is possible though .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
we love entertain@@ ment .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
we &apos;re losing them .
oh , my god !
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
thank you . thank you .
three times out of 10 .
that &apos;s your only chance .
which was a@@ wes@@ ome .
a long time , yes .
this is ste@@ phen watt .
the sun is ris@@ ing .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , so to speak .
thank you very much , guys .
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
explore .
what a fish .
i actually am .
thanks so much .
that was all .
wonderful , right ?
and they did .
they all matter .
totally in@@ efficient .
that &apos;s efficient .
not very sustainable .
play &apos;s essential .
very different notion .
so meet al .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
nothing will happen .
what did they do ?
ban is blan@@ k .
i was ama@@ zed .
it is gener@@ ic .
pretty good , right ?
quite a few more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he answers the door .
so they know everything .
1,000 , very good .
good job ! yeah !
that &apos;s super important .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
and this was fascinating .
that is do@@ able .
what would you say ?
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
so what happens here ?
thank you very much .
sound familiar ? right .
why not live longer ?
they have similar principles .
oh , that guy .
hey , why not ?
that &apos;s our present .
that &apos;s the system .
you could see manhattan .
this was the result .
there &apos;s no normal .
centers were establi@@ shed .
just do your job .
all that interests me .
so what happened here ?
len@@ to , slow .
yes , hell@@ o .
yes , hell@@ o .
and that &apos;s important .
can i be honest ?
but you know what ?
it has sensor@@ s .
we can do that .
what was the result ?
here is the video .
yes , milli@@ seconds .
but you know what ?
sc@@ ore them again .
that &apos;s very good .
the whole environmental discussion .
these guys make money .
yeah , i know .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re using their hands .
why do we do that ?
fly away , c@@ at .
and it must go back .
it &apos;s not a country .
so this is a wish .
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
i don &apos;t believe that .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
i &apos;ve got a question .
how do we know that ?
and i was an artist .
because , you know something ?
yes , that &apos;s possible .
we can do it differently .
so how does it happen ?
let &apos;s call him don .
how enga@@ ged you are .
what will these people want ?
can we do this differently ?
and those days are gone .
b@@ g : thank you .
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
this is the last one .
you can enter inside it .
so this is for real .
so where do we go ?
this would have been fine .
and i thought about that .
what is the media today ?
so let &apos;s have a look .
let me give you an example .
so , you can do it .
they &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
i was ex@@ posed to him .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
and i went back to work .
okay . thank you very much .
this is happening to us today .
well she was back all right .
hu@@ h . hang on a moment .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
thank you .
and so , we need energy mira@@ cles .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
one of two things is going to happen .
but i car@@ ried on with my work .
there &apos;s nothing po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in it .
the first two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
why do this ?
it won &apos;t .
it feels great .
i &apos;m surprised .
thanks for listening .
they actually hurt .
i swe@@ ar .
i represent children .
and i understand that .
i am a writer .
it goes against justice .
j@@ k : both .
the first : cut .
maybe 10 times more .
be a ment@@ or .
turn the camera off .
my hun@@ ches again .
but the wrong things .
thank you very much .
after only one trip .
yeah . all right .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so here it is .
tremend@@ ously challen@@ ging .
the data came back .
what creates the illusion ?
and so i did .
so i made one .
here &apos;s another example .
but it hadn &apos;t .
there is no feed .
people were going crazy .
but it gets worse .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
he liked it very much .
does anyone see anything specific ?
he is my grand@@ father .
good after@@ noon , everybody .
and then it went international .
so let me rec@@ ap .
this is an old study .
we have online crimin@@ als .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
that is a fantastic question .
some have come and gone .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
here you see the city .
it was different in china .
so here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m totally with you .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
th@@ ank@@ fully , right ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and then it happened again .
it &apos;s not our problem .
but that &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i never will forget it .
or is it photograph@@ y ?
okay , a bit more .
what is the sou@@ l ?
but there &apos;s another thing .
this is really cool . &quot;
very expensive real e@@ state .
yes , there it is .
and the answer is no .
and it even got better .
keep going . have fun .
crisis . death . disaster .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
she did it in secret .
we &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
he had had the experience .
and why is it true ?
you make compar@@ is@@ ons .
an almost iden@@ tical structure .
and i always have been .
give pe@@ e a chance .
we have three main groups .
and i felt really good .
i will never forget it .
have you seen these guys ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what needed to be done ?
there were still fis@@ hes .
and many people forget this .
there are billions of them .
will i like the color ?
my name is am@@ it .
priv@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
aw@@ w , thank you .
is that your opini@@ on ?
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
his name is paul off@@ it .
they sort of go like this .
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted .
that &apos;s the two ##AT##-##AT## @@ cent tour .
the work of the interpre@@ ter .
that does not hold for emotions .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
but where are we of use ?
well , what does that mean ?
let &apos;s call him don too .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we humans actually function ?
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened years after@@ ward ?
and i grew up in india .
but what are your fish eating ?
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
we made this game in 2007 .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i don &apos;t love that question .
what do you think happened then ?
that &apos;s ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
now , what does that mean ?
is it something about the light ?
inv@@ enting his own narra@@ tive .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
you can see the water coming .
who are these cou@@ s@@ ins ?
i want to ask a question .
we need to get the message out .
you can see this at the bottom .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
why not think about it this way ?
what am i going to look at ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we love technology . we love creativity .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
but what are we doing with it ?
is it going to be my size ?
that &apos;s about all it can do .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
most people here have heard of them .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
and it op@@ ens up a map .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
so , what do we have to do ?
and this is fe@@ li@@ x , actually .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
and that means there are too many of us .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
we were a group of tw@@ ent@@ y people .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have b@@ ones .
so , i &apos;m going to wra@@ p up now .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
very sc@@ ary .
they called me .
super@@ ior technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are coming .
the sou@@ l is something mental , lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z said .
what is decisi@@ ve , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s val@@ id .
that means that instead of having individual memor@@ ies , we have standar@@ dis@@ ed , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memor@@ ies , onto which we can atta@@ ch our personal memor@@ ies .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
this is really exciting .
but the point is ...
how about fit@@ ness ?
what happens is this .
and then pres@@ ented .
and that &apos;s nothing .
what what happened there ?
one is south korea .
why should i worry ?
they really loved it .
same thing , only bigger .
well , i was next .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
here you have it again .
so what why ha@@ cking ?
finally : epi@@ c meaning .
this picture &apos;s from there .
so that started the journey .
first over@@ time , second .
want to feed the world ?
it connected those two people .
my wife told me it .
but it was very sad .
and what is that thing ?
you could have done better .
and here &apos;s the thing .
but they do the job .
that &apos;s very ris@@ ky .
does that make you curious ?
and how did you feel ?
and that worked pretty well .
because you can train that .
and the answer is yes .
i wanted to support them .
i sometimes push too hard .
and then everybody moved down .
i was in a@@ we .
her mother raised her alone .
like that , you know .
who does the very best ?
tell me about this world .
i see this plus sign .
and here is a surprise .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
thank you for your attention .
this happened around christ@@ mas .
okay , there &apos;s some .
you saw the big peak .
and it took 18 months .
think about your own choices .
so it &apos;s a circle .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
she shares her experience with others .
all right , let &apos;s go .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it was a huge success .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
you know , is it rational ?
this data was not available before .
how many people would choose creativity ?
pattern recogni@@ tion should also work .
this was my first sun@@ burn .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
that &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
so you can have this cloud .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
your plant can b@@ low up .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
and this made me really sad .
they then also say , why ?
so what happened on this day ?
everybody talks about happiness these days .
they were still kind of happy .
so let me re@@ mind you .
it really comes from these artists .
she was back and near death .
now how could this come about ?
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
this is a game for outside .
and i memor@@ i@@ zed everything .
does anybody know what this is ?
he showed it to ja@@ vier .
for example perception in this context .
so that &apos;s the good news .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
now we talk about water wars .
she did it for three years .
it is a completely different notion .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know .
they were seeing something ma@@ gical .
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
he was actually colle@@ cting fish .
no had never been an option .
okay , we can do that .
how could we help you ? &quot;
is it just imag@@ in@@ ary ?
you have not changed the story .
and there &apos;s good news here .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
so what was the next step ?
this is not a finished story .
but there are two problems with that .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
so not like a de@@ to@@ x .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
the whole building is made of water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
what should our report card look like ?
but , but , you know what ?
you can play with a different type .
they are building an epi@@ c story .
everybody needs a fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l .
and really you do the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other br@@ ands are like that ?
so the white lines here are population .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
and he actually says it that way .
and then some very funny things happened .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
this is a lot of volu@@ me .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i mean , that was epi@@ c .
the data says it all the time .
and we absor@@ b all of it .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
let &apos;s make it kog@@ i . &quot;
it &apos;s this , just like this .
so , paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
which one would you like the most ?
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
it doesn &apos;t have this sou@@ l .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
i began to feel a bit better .
an au@@ ti@@ stic pu@@ pi@@ l .
now this is one of the images .
we went and looked at a site .
and here you have the graphic again .
we are depen@@ dent on two countries .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
because technologi@@ cally it &apos;s just not possible .
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
that &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot boat .
four and a half thousand people live there .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
and one time we caught a live one .
and she &apos;s hit@@ ting a 25@@ 7 .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent .
we can apply these things to other examples .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
and so there are too many of us .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and the form has something to do with it .
slowly but sur@@ ely , it li@@ f@@ ted .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
and then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun .
so this is all of the meta@@ -@@ data information .
and it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
it will start to look more and more like you .
and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit something to you .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ements about reality .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
the other nur@@ se asked ma@@ tter@@ -@@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ fac@@ tly .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
it sounds sc@@ ary .
um , my brand ?
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a tech@@ no@@ pho@@ be .
and i got in my car and i went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
and as soon as i walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
another very exciting phenomenon .
next would be nuclear .
leave that up to us .
but totally effective , right ?
it &apos;s entirely in@@ significant .
thanks for you pati@@ ence .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
and i tried something interesting .
we are a smaller brand .
just be who you are .
and the family gather@@ ed .
i remember my first fire .
but we need this everywhere .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
zero emissions , you see ?
what defin@@ es a story ?
and his answer was yes .
the reasons for writing it .
something sho@@ ots through my head .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
at least not to navi@@ gate .
why did i go into medicine ?
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
all the adults knew the risks .
were you ever en@@ vi@@ ous ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
so the cor@@ relation is low .
the truth is more like this .
the match begins -- sil@@ ence .
do you want them dist@@ ressed ?
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
yes , here is the data .
so , i just started playing .
talk about getting by with nothing .
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
and this video is real time .
i like things that are different .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
and it really changed the dynamic .
i went to prison -- difficult .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
because to me it means memory .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
isn &apos;t that a@@ wes@@ ome ?
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
and then we said , okay ,
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally .
how and what did they feel ?
it can know where we are .
that &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
we say sustain@@ ability in germany .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
but what will come in the future ?
this is a photograph of the object .
do you know what en@@ vy is ?
it is kind of a crazy idea .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
that must be our difference in age .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
you can show that you were there .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
do we really want to go there ?
they had been pus@@ hed gene@@ tically .
music is medicine . music changes us .
he only has use of his eyes .
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
i could draw . i could paint .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
something sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed inside me .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
that image remin@@ ded me of something .
i am a re@@ defined physi@@ cian .
priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
because we live on a water planet .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
i like really nice clo@@ th@@ es .
and there are several reasons for this .
le@@ go made it acc@@ essi@@ ble .
we started this over 15 years ago .
we can win back our nutri@@ ents .
thinking , you know , two percent .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
it turns out to be really difficult .
how far would you get with that ?
and those are the neu@@ ral structures .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
if you think about it , right ?
you can go all the way through .
you &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person .
and so we measu@@ red its motion .
and that can make a big difference .
but the reality is far from it .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
to the book and to the image .
sun@@ light and co2 is one method ...
so with that , i thank you .
that &apos;s just about the minim@@ um .
this has nothing to do with science .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
five million people use it every month .
but it does require a lot of planning .
it causes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
now we do the same with air@@ planes .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mond now .
i fell out of love with this fish .
de@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
i would like to prove that to you .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
and every morning i ho@@ p on it .
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
he was over six@@ ty at the time .
that was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
and that &apos;s a very sensi@@ ble question .
was a very a very fan@@ cy project .
this is hit@@ ting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and it will sound completely different from before .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
but then you really want to go deep .
and the object of this is quite simple .
architec@@ ts and engineers , th@@ ank@@ fully .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
and i had to get out of town .
here &apos;s their ja@@ m a@@ is@@ le .
her father died soon after she was born .
and i began giving her my ra@@ p .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
so , this crazy story might be true .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapi@@ dly .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
because i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
the bri@@ cks are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
and this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ eline .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
we &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which br@@ ands .
and then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
we can re ##AT##-##AT## @@ inv@@ ent things all over again .
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
and it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much .
they even can bring with them some finan@@ cing .
they are usually for@@ gotten by the third term .
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
he &apos;s wa@@ sting his time on non@@ sense .
i call this &quot; sh@@ in@@ y tiger . &quot;
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
and that has to do with phosp@@ hor@@ us .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i fo@@ unded an institute with this in mind .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imag@@ ined .
i know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
in fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
over here , these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
today they &apos;re called project ex@@ ecu@@ ting organizations .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distribu@@ ted yet .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
he &apos;ll auto@@ matically go to the right thought .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
amazing ! the machin@@ ery is kind of l@@ oud .
the result of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity . i love it .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
we have reach@@ ed a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
and nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
with people , it is rele@@ ased in the ur@@ ine .
so , the living give birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
the other one had a lot of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i don &apos;t know who re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ es what .
there &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
that &apos;s more than 250 hundre@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very ni@@ c@@ ely together .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
here this lo@@ gic is expres@@ sed in this de@@ cep@@ tive dis@@ course .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
say what you feel .
it &apos;s completely direc@@ ted .
he died broken by history .
we &apos;re still extremely atta@@ ched to story@@ telling as a method of information bro@@ ker@@ age .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fir@@ es and are happy when the fire fl@@ ar@@ es up .
this this hin@@ t at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out l@@ oud .
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@ c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@ ies to stone and have ero@@ ded our ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise .
here &apos;s the building working .
you always lose rare animals .
they spe@@ ared each other .
it will get to you .
they stopped us from being inspired .
i represent people on death row .
so , please for@@ give me .
i had written these crazy things .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i think this is really cool .
let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
now we see the opposite effect .
so two cy@@ cles are created .
we design unique elements into this .
that might sound unusual at first .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
... meaning not so optimi@@ stic .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
so scot@@ t gets this call .
everybody appl@@ au@@ ded poli@@ tely .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
so i followed my hun@@ ches .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
introdu@@ ce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
it &apos;s part of our life .
what do you think happens next ?
we worked well into each night .
there are . there always are .
the side product is clean water .
he re@@ treated into sil@@ ence .
he turns off the eng@@ ines .
it might take a moment to load .
let me read you the ent@@ ry .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel actually .
from the modern to the computer society .
and curi@@ osity can &apos;t be learned .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
so , this is world without oil .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an , exactly .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
and it was what i was feeling .
over the h@@ ills and all that .
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
that is exactly what you are doing .
this is true . i believe this .
but with the right design , please .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
we can support them in doing good .
something really weird is going on here .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
what will these three billion people bring ?
we were given very accu@@ rate data .
it was really , really quite profound .
so humans can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
we can support them in doing good .
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
you should ask for some of that .
even cat@@ s were watching this video .
the roof also is covered with water .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
that &apos;s also a paradig@@ m shift .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
first you see from back to front .
i never knew him in real life .
we need to go far , quickly .
sexual re@@ production en@@ ters the picture .
we talk about b@@ old , fresh .
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
i felt like anyone could do that .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
that will take place next apri@@ l .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are cell phones of the future .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ five milli@@ seconds ?
then i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
so that was the reason for the project .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
that which i just pres@@ ented to you .
so it &apos;s fe@@ eding back on itself .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
let me tell you a bit about it .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is open ##AT##-##AT## @@ source .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t in relationships . &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
the che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a so@@ le@@ m@@ n part .
the shor@@ es are from a different location .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
and that was the on@@ set of als .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
not even the truth will set them free .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent sources .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television chan@@ nel .
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
do@@ sage has something to do with this .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
and just to say , what is information ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
you put a box like this over there .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
they were ma@@ turing at five centi@@ meters .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
this is a mo@@ dest little ap@@ p .
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
his personal impres@@ sions of the water@@ li@@ lies .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
a particularly nice story , in my opini@@ on .
eating an entire bow@@ l of cool whi@@ p .
that &apos;s how people imagine the sou@@ l works .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
he will have to process that as the present .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
alone , as@@ ham@@ ed and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
fe@@ ast@@ ing ? i was totally conf@@ used .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
my cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
protect the environment , produce less ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h .
now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance policy .
a language is a flas@@ h of the human spirit .
these devices aren &apos;t acc@@ essi@@ ble to people . &quot;
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
i do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
but play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
and he had po@@ sted lots of nature videos in fact .
in other do@@ ma@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
thank you guys very much . that was a@@ wes@@ ome .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
that &apos;s just a working ti@@ tle , by the way .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
so , what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this ?
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
so you could call it the trans@@ lation of a trans@@ lation .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
and the emer@@ g@@ . staf@@ f pulled out all the st@@ ops .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
there &apos;s no in@@ sur@@ ance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
in two hours it &apos;s bio@@ de@@ gra@@ ded , wher@@ ever it is .
instru@@ ments have developed .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
or take li@@ p@@ stick .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
the first theor@@ em is , kl@@ aus cla@@ ims there is no sou@@ l .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes a lo@@ gic to us .
this is about virtu@@ ality , about non ##AT##-##AT## @@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , about story@@ telling .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vi@@ ral video , bear .
remember those na@@ pp@@ ies again ?
mon@@ day : color is powerful .
and that generally looks like this .
imagine mo@@ z@@ art being efficient .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
they actually make us worse off .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
so give me a hand here .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
if you burn coal , no .
the flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed .
we asked around and nobody knew .
she kind of set us up .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
and the list can go on forever .
and the problem is not technology itself .
say , there are no predic@@ tors .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
second half . end of normal time .
everybody was having some ca@@ ke earlier .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so what are arch@@ a@@ ic models ?
that means something built in a city .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
let me show you how they work .
you can zo@@ om around very simply .
maybe we can see it as change .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
so just imagine that for a moment .
just spread it as wide as possible .
we think about energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
can you play it in blue now ?
people were suffering . people were fighting .
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
that &apos;s what the nor@@ m says .
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
raise your hands . let me see .
and let me begin with one example .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
you move around , you have fun .
re@@ power america . find out more .
i call it the ris@@ ing billion .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
protect the environment , consu@@ me less energy .
they need to tell me about my brand .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
now you see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
my fourth techni@@ que : condition for complexity .
and i thought i could bl@@ end in .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
which is great , because we need that .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
i wanted to re@@ store health from disease .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
my parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
and let me show you a simple example .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predic@@ table .
life hadn &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is key .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
i was trying to preser@@ ve the body .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
well i went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
you can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
we object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
the three words are : do you remember ?
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
it &apos;s the so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called o@@ sit model .
but so many over the years were helped .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
their problem is that they have too little .
now i put a b@@ ass line in .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
this is about one percent of the total population .
no one has to gre@@ en ##AT##-##AT## @@ light your idea .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ person .
everything that &apos;s inside can be u@@ tili@@ zed .
our obje@@ ctive was to simply say , okay ,
seriously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
they were exactly like the people in this room .
we have been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
oh , so jes@@ us , what a thought !
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
so that made sense , that was a match .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and that &apos;s a multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ million dollar corpo@@ ration .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intui@@ tive .
so again , that was a real good match .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photographs .
you can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
we need to go for more research fund@@ ing .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
let me give you good close look at this .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
this is something that has to get to zero .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
and in that time you can re@@ act differently .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
it &apos;s all com@@ post@@ able all of it .
the internet and its services are a mira@@ cle .
here &apos;s this couple on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
what we want to do is make the future .
china can make up for that in one second .
my grand@@ parents pus@@ hed that number to 70 .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
the first on here is the classi@@ c , apple .
it was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagination .
they &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
so two cou@@ ples each conc@@ ei@@ ving one baby .
and we keep setting our expec@@ tations higher and higher .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
normally now , i would take the need@@ le out .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global theme .
story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ sensor@@ ial .
that is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart grid .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
ini@@ tially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they live in an environment of che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
ladies and gentle@@ men , meet your cou@@ s@@ ins .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sele@@ ct government .
we had to take them out , which we did .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
every foot@@ print is dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous there .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly 150 miles back .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
it &apos;s all bo@@ und by oxygen and silic@@ ates .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
well it was a fri@@ day , this is true .
let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
you can see on the left side a small boat .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
thank you so much for inv@@ enting behavi@@ oral economics .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
these theor@@ em@@ s are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
that our input to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
and i have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since i was 16 .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 kids .
i no longer want to post@@ po@@ ne anything in life .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hit@@ ter ?
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
let &apos;s take s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers for example , right ?
i made it and i set to work tre@@ ating her .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
i want you to notice two things from this cur@@ ve .
so now for the top@@ ic of today : financial sav@@ ings .
and we want to make this material acc@@ essi@@ ble to everyone .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
i could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
smart gri@@ ds are a hot top@@ ic at the moment everywhere .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
in this way , every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
actually no , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever .
instead , let &apos;s look to the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
it was four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
and everything is either the pac@@ k@@ aging or the cont@@ ents .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
so not saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
and those that were like that started to spli@@ t and divi@@ de .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
it was bus@@ y , i was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
there are also technical cy@@ cles .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
everybody is now trying to re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise something in this pattern .
we don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
in the beginning there was the tri@@ b@@ al society , charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by language .
a third theor@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong atta@@ ch@@ ment to the idea of a sou@@ l .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they rever@@ sed the flow of water .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ enting life .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
and in this mind they had memory .
and how does it look in there ?
and so that got me very excited .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
you probably saw it on the news .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
in those countries where people have money .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
save those . kill off the rest .
how about living longer with good health ?
everyone take their vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
the only thing they had was their mind .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
these na@@ pp@@ ies are everywhere prac@@ tically .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
all right , what is brand ger@@ ry ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
so to him , they were just blocks .
one i thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
i didn &apos;t know the proto@@ col@@ s .
we have tw@@ ent@@ y percent in germany .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
and there is this stun@@ ning sil@@ ence .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ gs set .
both are vi@@ able ; both take off .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
given all of that , mistakes are inevi@@ table .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ und@@ ant animals .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we have the tools with this exponenti@@ al technology .
so you can re@@ constru@@ ct a whole movement .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
and we can see that it can be done .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
so now they understand the value of prototyp@@ ing .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle c@@ ry .
so we must get the phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and actually i become a character in the book .
so i think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
well , i think number one is curi@@ osity .
and i put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
and so every drop was a little bit different .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
of course not everything should be com@@ post@@ able .
we would never do that in our own countries .
here are the results we just ob@@ tain@@ ed .
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial .
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
yes , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
go@@ od@@ night swe@@ et o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
beginn@@ ers &apos; clas@@ ses har@@ dly talk about interpretation .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
in 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and , being young , i said , expec@@ tation .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
it &apos;s about making a bene@@ ficial po@@ op print .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ ve comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he &apos;s only dec@@ ei@@ ving you and not himself .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
... these do@@ sages have something to do with it .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
and ultimately , we have to embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x ##AT##-##AT## @@ second period .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
and they didn &apos;t have phot@@ oli@@ th@@ ograph@@ y .
good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
now he &apos;s brought a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
to form a phr@@ ase with one &apos;s own breath .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it plays .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
i made the decision to move to the u.@@ s .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
and she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
it is nat@@ anz , and it is only nat@@ anz .
let &apos;s make a short pro@@ visi@@ onal app@@ rais@@ al .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
and we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
but will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
this is the call center for the services and information line .
that &apos;s the kind of sh@@ ame that is a teacher .
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other .
we have the passion of the di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
em@@ c pres@@ ents : &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency . &quot;
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contro@@ ls in our car .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
we &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
creates a bon@@ d , creates a bon@@ d of respect .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
you are virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ing the reality without a computer .
i thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once .
so it &apos;s got c@@ ute little game dynam@@ ics on it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
people in the satelli@@ te room are starting to move in now .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
but you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
would you like to be more attra@@ ctive and self ##AT##-##AT## @@ confi@@ dent ?
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
but phosp@@ hor@@ us will not be able to be re@@ placed .
tu@@ es@@ day : fit@@ ting in is way over@@ r@@ ated .
when i say re@@ alism , i mean phot@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ re@@ alism .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the dog ! i was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integra@@ te the two .
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . forever . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three ##AT##-##AT## @@ month period .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
then i would say , my warm con@@ dol@@ ences , you see ?
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the op@@ tions of it .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
i can say , the ger@@ man chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant anymore .
and we get to re ##AT##-##AT## @@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
i have a nice , con@@ cre@@ te example to illu@@ strate this .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
these results have been ob@@ tain@@ ed over several weeks of really hard labor .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high ##AT##-##AT## @@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
th@@ ank@@ fully many studies are being car@@ ried out on this top@@ ic .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;@@ am , i do . &quot;
and you can actually say things here that have im@@ pac@@ ts around the world .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
i can cla@@ im anything .
i can cla@@ im anything .
imagine then just two other little changes .
but we know that if we were to say that out l@@ oud , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively dist@@ ur@@ bed .
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , such as non ##AT##-##AT## @@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly an it@@ em in the daily new@@ spa@@ pers .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quot@@ ation mar@@ ks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly mention a project .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
so please listen when music is played .
so go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
so you could feel good about selling it .
we can take a look at that now .
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
but what this image represents was the problem .
that it comes to the human from outside .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
the second factor is the services we use .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird programs .
so here we have some natural fire@@ flies .
so ants wei@@ gh more than we do .
go bo@@ ther leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
because they have special skills of facili@@ tation .
and his whole work process changed after that .
we called it digital water pa@@ vili@@ on .
you look around at all these muse@@ ums here .
how much money does it take to do this ?
gr@@ ants and spon@@ sor@@ s were sou@@ ght .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
think about this : this attack is gener@@ ic .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
and this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
and we built an i@@ pad app@@ lic@@ ation .
this is another look at the tree of life .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
here , let me give you an analog@@ y .
they were moving towards a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
the first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees .
and these women would get together and just talk .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
he says , &quot; bra@@ ce for impact . &quot;
so we start with a windows dro@@ pp@@ er .
and the third area spea@@ ks for itself really .
they divi@@ ded the entire king@@ dom in half .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
you zo@@ om in . you really go in .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
if you have something to give , give it now .
the next one : this was the best day ever .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fix@@ ed them .
it exp@@ ands in winter and contra@@ cts in summer .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and i see the same process with combin@@ ing photographs .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of ja@@ m .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
but our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to face .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
ant@@ ony@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
and the world we now live in looks like this .
it actually is much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please b@@ low up . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bom@@ b .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
play is the gl@@ ue that bin@@ ds us together .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
everyone knew your geni@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
but the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so sex can come in lots of different var@@ ie@@ ties .
are you min@@ d@@ ful , sophisti@@ cated like 00@@ 7 ?
and then it &apos;s less us@@ able or user friend@@ ly .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
and we actually build stron@@ ger social relationships as a result .
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so that &apos;s occu@@ py@@ thes@@ e@@ c movement has done .
i mean i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
but what about this day , this one particular fri@@ day ?
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ attle .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this ent@@ ry .
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a c@@ age .
in the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ v@@ ators .
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are aware of each other .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
we went back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
the experi@@ en@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th ##AT##-##AT## @@ generation fu@@ els .
it &apos;s a type of terri@@ tor@@ ial behavior , right ?
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
how can i make something as user friend@@ ly as possible ?
it &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
each society is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by one primary medium .
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
and i think there &apos;s almost a parado@@ x with those .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment .
because artists have a di@@ stor@@ ted relationship to the lie .
now , chimpanze@@ es are well ##AT##-##AT## @@ known for their ag@@ gr@@ ession .
and &quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll into a decade .
well , we pres@@ ented this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ loch .
so , i say : let the worl@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ changing games begin .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
he rob@@ bed every o@@ un@@ ce of hope from my being .
and i understood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
so paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of having too many choices .
now , this is an inter@@ active carto@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
fr@@ ance sc@@ or@@ es . it@@ al@@ y sc@@ or@@ es .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
30 years ago that would have so@@ unded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
we are talking about -- around about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
in reality the notes are very va@@ gue and im@@ pre@@ cise .
there &apos;s an econom@@ ist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzz@@ le still being put together .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous sc@@ ents .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstra@@ ct information .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glas@@ ses .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
now the fish is on the i@@ u@@ c@@ n red list .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y .
how do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
the next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it .
what are some other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
we don &apos;t get that kind of const@@ ant feedback in real life .
so we don &apos;t have the bud@@ gets that other br@@ ands have .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ entation that we have to change .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you know , nothing is possible in this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l . &quot;
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
i &apos;ll be reve@@ aling what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
so it says , &quot; place your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
so , simple : you come to goog@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on the top@@ ic natural user interface design .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
i sell pet to@@ ys all over the country , all over the world .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
that &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can twi@@ st that around .
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
thir@@ t@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
those are spaces that are able to re@@ act to a human intelli@@ g@@ ently .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .

you &apos;ll need some lo@@ gic here , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in tw@@ ent@@ y years .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace .
we no longer produce .
i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
the disaster is for that two billion .
you know , you can choose your list .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
so if you think of the google glas@@ ses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concep@@ ts that allows us to com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our aff@@ in@@ ity for virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ation , of experi@@ en@@ cing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being add@@ ressed again .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
... paying attention to crow@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ sour@@ cing .
she had ir@@ rever@@ si@@ ble brain damage .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
and of course how design affec@@ ts perception .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
he s@@ mil@@ ed and said , oh ?
they put her on a venti@@ l@@ ator .
ok , think of this as extreme self ##AT##-##AT## @@ motivation .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .

well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
but we know very little about where things go .
just like it used to happen in the village .
i know what people think when they see this .
it &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
but combin@@ ed , they can create something like this .
not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
what will they consu@@ me ? what will they desire ?

that &apos;s a funny oc@@ curr@@ ence , you know .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .

it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .

there &apos;s already a rather impres@@ sive number of people worldwide .

you can just say a few names and people will understand .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .

so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t regi@@ ster@@ ed .

but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
but what if you want to see br@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the ei@@ gh@@ ties .
and then we tried out a whole load of simu@@ lations .
and that is an es@@ cape from his tor@@ mented state .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you are you really serious ?
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , t@@ ar ##AT##-##AT## @@ like fla@@ vor .

what &apos;s that new state that the world is head@@ ing toward ?
a friend of mine did that -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra@@ ps .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
it is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and he &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so , he &apos;s rational .
it is not only a nice w@@ all@@ paper made of noise .
you see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
my male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and today we are still very , very depen@@ dent on stories .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
and i can tell you that this is a transforma@@ tive experience .
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
it &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular community .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logi@@ cal side either .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ?
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
this is a simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
and as we get older , the na@@ pp@@ ies get bigger .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign c@@ .@@ a .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ ist .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s un@@ fair .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
secon@@ dly , photos combin@@ ed should have the same type of light .
and also anything they would con@@ j@@ ure up in their minds today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
and oil will be able to be re@@ placed by other energy sources .
bla@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , and other things that are sc@@ ary .
only i think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
yeah , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ ops .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fla@@ vor , too .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
the more money you ear@@ n , the more satis@@ fied you are .
and so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
and they actually ill@@ umin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : they are lost forever .
before this , we were in the so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called age of feu@@ d@@ alism .
well , their experi@@ en@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who bat@@ s 300 .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
and i saw mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
so there is no exc@@ use for any of us here in this audience .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
it &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
and all the while , i was a@@ mas@@ sing more and more knowledge .
it was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in janu@@ ary .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of e@@ den .
they have a distin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighb@@ ors . thanks .
in h@@ oll@@ and we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
so , i was completely s@@ mitten by this , and had to do more .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
and how it fol@@ ds dic@@ tat@@ es its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effec@@ tivity .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ phan@@ ies .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
a couple months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten all about it .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub ##AT##-##AT## @@ choices of course .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , i &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
if you are happy , you are going to attra@@ ct other happy people to you .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany . &quot;
one con@@ sequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ world work ?
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
a kind of ast@@ on@@ ishing er@@ ror rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stron@@ ger , with more stam@@ ina .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ na@@ pp@@ y stage , so to speak .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
and i had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but co@@ di@@ fy them through language .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times sa@@ f@@ ely out of every 10 .
it &apos;s a very rare occasi@@ on that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ berg roll@@ ing .
the first example works with the pres@@ um@@ ption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
well there are opportunities all around us .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
that &apos;s where he sig@@ ned up .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
so let &apos;s project this analog@@ y going forward .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ style assem@@ bly language .
and in ber@@ lin there was this crazy engineering collective .
it will lose half of its value in one year .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
there &apos;s the a direct re@@ turning system for this .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
cat@@ s were watching other cat@@ s watch this video .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
we can see that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
a all the beautiful things in life are in@@ efficient .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
we have to engage with the machin@@ ery of government .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
and what i realized is i needed an exper@@ t .
and i talked them into fund@@ ing an expedi@@ tion .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
the cost of solar dro@@ pped 50 percent last year .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poetry .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
i play to explain what these t@@ ones might have meant .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
because all of these technologies are fe@@ eding back on themselves .
if it stopped twi@@ t@@ ching , you bur@@ y them .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system su@@ cks .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i knew she had come to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and other another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
so they go around and do art instal@@ lations like this .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
we think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ ells good , too .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
the typical wal@@ m@@ art today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
i say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
but our perception , how it dec@@ ei@@ ves us too .
i mean , this is just my logi@@ cal side talking .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in have ?
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you fe@@ eding ? &quot;
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
i walked through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participa@@ te .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the is@@ lan@@ ders .
and i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the sus@@ pen@@ se .
so i wear two hat@@ s in most of what i do .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
it was the threat of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped their lives .
but it turns out syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing dna is very difficult .
that &apos;s what kee@@ ps us going and kee@@ ps us developing .
there &apos;s ste@@ p ##AT##-##AT## @@ b@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hu@@ d@@ son river .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
so the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved you .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
and what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
we think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies .
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very ra@@ pid .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle to their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
but the point is , we still come to gala@@ pa@@ gos .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
because with marine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
now it &apos;s only at pre@@ cise times when they al@@ ig@@ n .
so the question is , how should we deal with na@@ pp@@ ies ?
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technologi@@ cal definition of platform here .
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
they live lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
and she asked him , so what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to help this patient ?
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
this is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e ##AT##-##AT## @@ book .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
when you go running , right , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
if we over@@ sho@@ ot , we can po@@ ur a little bit back .
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge er@@ ror .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non ##AT##-##AT## @@ image data .
this is called the e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is an a@@ ver@@ a@@ ge ##AT##-##AT## @@ size green@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ e@@ berg .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ f@@ its bring with her ?
i was given the gift of a mira@@ cle , of not dying that day .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimul@@ ating conversation .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs inside dete@@ c@@ tors .
because it doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack it should go to first .
this is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
we can di@@ ve in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
car colors , ex@@ teri@@ or car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tives .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opini@@ on , even come from the muse@@ ums .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare black@@ -@@ shoul@@ dered ki@@ te .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
the r &amp; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fund@@ ed .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty a@@ wes@@ ome .
that is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of ourselves .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ on@@ g@@ ly con@@ vi@@ cted .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
we &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not har@@ m@@ ful .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent at the moment .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the mom@@ a , again in new york .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
this is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
a young la@@ d like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fir@@ es .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanze@@ es , your living clo@@ s@@ est relative .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit complexity .
i &apos;d like to rein@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to a particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty jum@@ ped up and he ran over to this older black man .
i don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
they spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sti@@ cks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
i &apos;m aware of the brea@@ thing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but i see this kid .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
here we have a the pro@@ of , by the way , that humans are not pig@@ s .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that i do .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concern@@ s about that .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ f@@ its right now .
and here i &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
socie@@ tal deca@@ y . 65 dead .
new invest@@ ments to create high ##AT##-##AT## @@ paying jobs .
this idea of fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this jan@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and forth .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
a piece of music that is interpre@@ ted for the um@@ p@@ te@@ ent@@ h time is compar@@ able in this way .
there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales in ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted sa@@ f@@ ely , hit sa@@ f@@ ely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
when you look at the people you deal with ..
so it &apos;s about effec@@ tivity , not efficiency .
and they did this using so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called lead maps .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
well let me work up some blood for you .
and instead of p@@ ani@@ cking , he just stopped .
he invited over to dinner the king of si@@ am .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
but somehow we can insu@@ late ourselves from this problem .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
turned tr@@ as@@ h@@ can on its side . walked home .
it would be so energi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
so when kl@@ aus says , there is no sou@@ l .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
and they are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , individuals .
here you see a sam@@ ple of this actual attack code .
so i looked into when things are natural and intui@@ tive .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on everyone &apos;s humanity .
this hit me when i went to replace my je@@ ans .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t result .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
we ki@@ cked his bed so that he could see out .
this air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilometers .
we &apos;re using games to es@@ cape re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ world suffering .
and six@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial cultures .
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ able environment for those bacteria .
an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you might know talks about this time .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t se@@ ttle .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self ##AT##-##AT## @@ rene@@ wing .
the greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
somebody broke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
you no longer need to whi@@ st@@ le or sing a song .
so that was a very successful ha@@ ck in my opini@@ on .
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ pants and that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this od@@ d country road .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
there was the le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen nuclear research plant .
now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it su@@ cks .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromo@@ some ?
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
photos like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
i grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y diet of science fi@@ ction .
a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
he said , &quot; we farm exten@@ si@@ vely , not intensi@@ vely .
it &apos;s an independent terri@@ tory . they control all miner@@ al resources .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
the secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ i@@ ties .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
well , that night , everybody went to celebra@@ te in the center .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
the com@@ pos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
so find the programs that come clo@@ s@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limit@@ ations .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represent ?
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embra@@ ce fear .
then , in my opini@@ on , a really good code was created .
it is actually the true integra@@ tion of the man and the machine .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing trip .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensi@@ ble design .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blocks had become the building block of our time .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the rene@@ w@@ able sources .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that purpose , has really changed my life .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
last year at ted i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i was giving some lec@@ tures in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
then my question is , how profession@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
and when they are com@@ promis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
i looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of condu@@ ct .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
some of my do@@ o@@ zi@@ es have been in the last five years .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
so the first rule is that photos combin@@ ed should have the same perspective .
that &apos;s where the dra@@ matic incre@@ ases have come in our prison population .
how does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
but nothing has been invented that en@@ ables me to walk , until now .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
so that &apos;s just one app@@ lic@@ ation among many that you can use .
this is my wi@@ f@@ i scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
should i respond to this email ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
that means they navi@@ g@@ ated through the use of sound and rhyth@@ m .
that &apos;s literally co@@ vering just like a two and a hal@@ f ##AT##-##AT## @@ week period .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ rich environments .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
even if you were to sho@@ ot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
and this is a syndro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
do you know what they call a 300 hit@@ ter in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the w@@ inning team .
and the great indi@@ c@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- forever .
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists there isn &apos;t such a test .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and that was the message that i absor@@ bed when i was in med school .
and my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , ted .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of moment@@ um .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
there was no key@@ board instrument such as the piano in b@@ ach &apos;s time .
we find other kinds of wei@@ r@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fair@@ er than you .
so we have a lot of very roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
and this piece of 5@@ 0 ##AT##-##AT## @@ year ##AT##-##AT## old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing to me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , i need you to go into the house .
it is about taking that which was sc@@ ar@@ ce and making it ab@@ und@@ ant .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
that &apos;s our yo@@ un@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
i &apos;m dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as adults .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
and our nation &apos;s really fo@@ unded on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be in@@ t@@ act again .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
if they could do it for them , sur@@ ely they could do it for me .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappe@@ ared .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absor@@ b and rele@@ ase phosp@@ hor@@ us .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
so , the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated in the creation of many mira@@ cles .
we &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ plo@@ aded to youtube every minute .
speci@@ alized skills and facili@@ tation skills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong success .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
and i played the first movement of the bee@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to .
the l@@ oud and soft sym@@ b@@ ols , f and b , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
that the human des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
what were their life circum@@ stances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qu@@ ish@@ es human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be ad@@ ded to that ?
three months later i had rel@@ oc@@ ated , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure has continu@@ ed .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundament@@ ally changed our world .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
the con@@ sequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise .
mark , mark , come back .
tsun@@ ami war@@ ning . cyber@@ -@@ attac@@ ks .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
but just sub@@ stit@@ ute a@@ partment building for cities .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gent .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
this rule of three con@@ tains three theor@@ em@@ s .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
and i tend to think of it like my sha@@ dow .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
you collect information about the piece in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappe@@ ars .
as the one hat , i do history of an@@ atom@@ y .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
it &apos;s both 3d scan@@ ning in real time and motion capture .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics .
so you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen ac@@ tively ?
there &apos;s nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology coming on , nan@@ o@@ materials .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether you like its taste or not .
and nei@@ ther your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it .
because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
to main@@ tain the dialo@@ gue , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er .
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at man@@ aging those choices ?
this is a very direct way to get back nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
as we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas .
it &apos;s when it@@ al@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ up .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ement about what is val@@ id .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .

and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices .
a cru@@ cial tool in information bro@@ ker@@ age has always been stories .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
you prac@@ tically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ ord here .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it brings together image and text and anima@@ tion and sound and touch .
all par@@ ties , all fac@@ tions in society , bac@@ ked this .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
and to see how we process information , how do we absor@@ b information ?
the sm@@ ells from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question of content of character ?
and those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
and we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like to explain them brie@@ fly .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
and we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and ##AT##-##AT## @@ half year period .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted@@ global .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
and i think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that &apos;s me .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropriate .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day .
we know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
today we can point at do@@ zens of companies that have done just that .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194@@ 6 .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
if your work bom@@ bed , not entirely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
and if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link cau@@ sation and cor@@ relation .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at ? &quot;
by 20@@ 20 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
interpre@@ ters are trans@@ lat@@ ors of the written notes in res@@ o@@ unding music .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
my story begins right here actually in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
writing books is my prof@@ ession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man .
we type , we fi@@ le , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlan@@ tic .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and then they start pil@@ ing up st@@ ones so your view is blo@@ cked .
at the end you want to susta@@ in mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my pres@@ entation .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core conc@@ ern of of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
whether the music is too pe@@ p@@ per@@ y or swe@@ et for your taste .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his ch@@ ie@@ f of staf@@ f .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anima@@ te objects feel the same way .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
and you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came up with this .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
that &apos;s high ##AT##-##AT## @@ tech agriculture of course , but the pl@@ ots take care of themselves .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
the united states now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
there are 6@@ 8 million people esti@@ ma@@ ted to be in wheel@@ cha@@ irs worldwide .
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving bell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot;
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
in order to ada@@ pt success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
that feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fing@@ ers .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
now , we love to wra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
this is a portra@@ it by a photograph@@ er named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
nasa has this phr@@ ase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transpor@@ tation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal computer is a mira@@ cle .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
you atta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
that &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this da@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ in and da@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ out .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
anybody who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
well , how do we boot up a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
and then we have to de@@ cre@@ ase our mu@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ run capac@@ i@@ ties in the network .
two equ@@ ally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ natur@@ es will can@@ c@@ el each other out .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
and from these , i can dri@@ ll into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
all cultures through all time have constantly been enga@@ ged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national g@@ aller@@ y .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
because the plant in frank@@ fur@@ t would be the best at w@@ inning back phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
i really do believe that , and , no , it a@@ in &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of metal .
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
you had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to go a long way .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ au@@ rus back then .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
and it just si@@ ts there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an et@@ ch a sk@@ et@@ ch .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor tony , temp@@ t , and his cause .
before we had a@@ wes@@ ome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
a work of art that is never looked at will never ga@@ ther the strength to have an effect .
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
all along , all fan@@ t@@ asy books have always had maps , but these maps have been sta@@ tic .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages .
you could try and exp@@ and the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
which of course very much ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ es for story@@ telling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
we have two beings , both conc@@ ei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .

he &apos;s interested in setting fir@@ es .
that &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
the second theor@@ em is th@@ us , if kl@@ aus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
it brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
according to which lo@@ gic do we dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate this de@@ ception , this self ##AT##-##AT## @@ de@@ ception , this will@@ ing@@ ness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is val@@ id in our un@@ conscious minds ?
but with this lo@@ gic , which just uses the fact that two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect and atta@@ ches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
drug war . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
it does not have a tan@@ gi@@ ble , material nature .
of those have you ever heard of over@@ population of trees ?
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
evolution does not necessarily fa@@ vor the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
imagine a big explosion as you clim@@ b through 3,000 ft .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
there will be a whole load of resi@@ stance and argu@@ ments .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
and that &apos;s the proje@@ ction of seeing , feedback , seeing .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
he types &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this offi@@ cial knowledge base .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expedi@@ tions .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bor@@ ed .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
from the age of feu@@ d@@ alism to the to the machine age .
the ground stor@@ es over six@@ ty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa ge@@ o@@ spa@@ tial image .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ based system the way we do .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my fi@@ le .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutri@@ ents .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
we did a game called super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute for the future .
how would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
all this influ@@ ences me and influ@@ ences my experience of the com@@ position .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
so if you think about this prac@@ tically , here &apos;s where we are .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c , a a bunch of ama@@ te@@ urs .
i say , ul@@ f , why do you need such a big car ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that he has something entirely different in mind .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dru@@ cker .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromo@@ som@@ es .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
but when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
why didn &apos;t i ask my atten@@ ding ? why did i send her home ?
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
but thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s arch@@ a@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there .
she wasn &apos;t going to vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against polio , no way .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
the const@@ ant f@@ loo@@ ding of music today is not very bene@@ ficial there .
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embra@@ ce risk .
it &apos;s not about being sc@@ ar@@ ce , it &apos;s about acc@@ essi@@ bility .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
but the spa@@ tial arr@@ ange@@ ment of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful .
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fra@@ mes .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese invasi@@ on .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ je@@ ction will kill you ?
in other words , every step here represents an order of magni@@ tude in performance scale .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still pri@@ mar@@ ily at .
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
you can only be climate neu@@ tra@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus v@@ acc@@ ine with a bunch of other people .
so one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but government played a key role here .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in ja@@ ils and pris@@ ons .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
so that what they had only con@@ ju@@ red up in their minds becomes listen@@ able .
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the 8@@ 0s .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five ##AT##-##AT## @@ cent tour .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also fri@@ days .
then i took a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser and connected it to that .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classi@@ cal music .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great ap@@ es .
they &apos;re pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensor@@ s .

what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written that would have contain@@ ed this in it ?
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .

that &apos;s the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on ##AT##-##AT## @@ the ##AT##-##AT## @@ job experience .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline .

this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
it &apos;s a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .

among those pa@@ pers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
some of them are also regi@@ ster@@ ed together with the ha@@ cker@@ spaces , those places .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started argu@@ ing .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .

turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ables up .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tion@@ ing as a single organis@@ m .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the kni@@ fe trick .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
every single harvard employe@@ e is now auto@@ matically en@@ roll@@ ed in a life@@ cycle fund .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .

he had a poten@@ tially life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condition called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
he asked me what the pre@@ am@@ ble to this bal@@ la@@ d was in my opini@@ on .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in sou@@ th ##AT##-##AT## @@ e@@ ast@@ -@@ asia .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and i promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this frame@@ work .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intelle@@ ct as we are .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?

and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the exp@@ o .

each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can &apos;t even guess at .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could re@@ build the organisation .

co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward one .
in this country , as many as 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of pre@@ vent@@ able medical er@@ r@@ ors .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
that &apos;s equivalent to the out@@ put of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver@@ ted particularly quickly .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stron@@ ger .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
you can also try it with words like re@@ ven@@ ge or ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and the like .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing over .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ishing thing .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have br@@ us@@ hed up against that thing , at times .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
and these two worl@@ ds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clas@@ hing with each other at the moment .
you see it straight away .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
tradition@@ ally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and laun@@ ch k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the i@@ pad .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
so it atta@@ ches a third theor@@ em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theor@@ em@@ s and only acts as if the opposite of the first theor@@ em had already been pro@@ ven and given pri@@ ority .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real <<unk>> scene <<unk>> , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting there and everything .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or , you might say , who believe that the sou@@ l brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the sou@@ l is an in@@ corpo@@ real frame@@ work around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of fl@@ es@@ h and blood , are soli@@ d , so to speak , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .

she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and these were the things she thought we needed to com@@ mit to .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the ama@@ zon forest alone .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
a big fis@@ her@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .

i talk about race and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything .

you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
and more than anything , are you being the best par@@ ent you can ?
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introdu@@ ce to you .
that means you can see how to win back nutri@@ ents on the internet .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
i had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ atom@@ y .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
we can re ##AT##-##AT## @@ imagine ad@@ ver@@ sity as something more than just tough times .
so we do need target theor@@ ies that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es with each one specific function .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self ##AT##-##AT## @@ interests .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path .

this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .

ad@@ ver@@ sity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there .
i think it &apos;s better if we encoura@@ ge our great creative minds to live .
because they changed their cha@@ ir@@ man of the board of direc@@ tors twice now .
the so , music fun@@ ctions a lot like spo@@ ken language in my opini@@ on .
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consi@@ der@@ ably more intui@@ tive and natural .
you see the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber .
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it runs through the women .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
not the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
that makes the baby carb@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
we need to find ways to embra@@ ce these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
went in , and i started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always ye@@ ar@@ ned for more creativity .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked ja@@ m for our experiment .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents .
the law of pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity , the law of of continu@@ ity , etc .
it came to the table a bright , almost shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
the united states is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with china .

at 17 she became the second wife of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
in it , there are always three dies@@ els running , two are always main@@ tain@@ ed .

this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ gles of con@@ go .

and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
so all of our intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be du@@ mber than trees .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e ##AT##-##AT## @@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ the ##AT##-##AT## @@ art clean coal facili@@ ty .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave la@@ tin america to go to the united states .

&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
that was then re@@ placed by the classi@@ cal age and the first type of abstra@@ ction .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
here &apos;s v@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is the kan@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
it &apos;s an open ##AT##-##AT## @@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
well , so it says pre@@ st@@ o at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c win .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
i think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
she li@@ kes him a lot , because he has the tenden@@ cy to be for@@ th@@ right .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bis@@ ho@@ p of wor@@ ce@@ ster .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
in terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ i@@ cide cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
the mel@@ o@@ dy is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhyth@@ m is created through dance .
it &apos;s not really what is reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks reali@@ stic really .
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er co@@ aster are you on ?
the brown bit is the conven@@ tional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environ@@ ment@@ ally aware .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
if you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
these are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
we use our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
i worked in the collective for el@@ even years , it was based on a gras@@ s@@ roots democracy .
so , as a designer , i design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appe@@ ar@@ ance .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
so it was curi@@ osity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pus@@ hing them more towards failure .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
i took the liber@@ ty i asked li@@ l@@ ly , if it would be okay to mention her .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- i &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
in the and@@ es , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of drin@@ king water for this city .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ noon , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and what what are our values and what are what are our obje@@ c@@ tives , our fundamental principles ?
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in febru@@ ary last year .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
so &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed anima@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
and the set was based as an ex@@ act repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city hall .
you can explain this much more el@@ abor@@ ately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
you introdu@@ ce a new idea and this is ans@@ wer@@ ed inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with a reaction .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ tain@@ ed right now .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
and those were the most primi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
so i want to extra@@ po@@ late on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic out@@ put of two hundred kil@@ o@@ watt + to the network .
they &apos;re on the ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h ti@@ ps , but also el@@ se@@ where in the landscape , right ?
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
and i &apos;ve been repres@@ enting these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sent@@ ences .
we want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
that number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rapi@@ dly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
so you sense it already .
now we have the third theor@@ em .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical do@@ ma@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their streng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
and similar to &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
and as a matter of fact , this fa@@ ke input data is actually pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net .
all the rest of that day , that after@@ noon , i had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my sto@@ mach .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about ex@@ ecu@@ ting people . &quot;

so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality ch@@ art organized by age .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all i put in my su@@ it@@ case .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
you take them away , disease comes back , horri@@ ble diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small bottle of po@@ ison .
so , you don &apos;t ab@@ sta@@ in from food just because you can &apos;t co@@ ok .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
mu@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequ@@ ency .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
a big machine , a cool , ted ##AT##-##AT## @@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
there are indi@@ c@@ ator fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , reser@@ ved , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director .
it ta@@ sted swe@@ et and clean , like you were taking a bi@@ te of the ocean .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ u@@ tions being cap@@ tured .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ use bri@@ ck .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pad , take the fire@@ flies out .
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
we talk about it in ir@@ onic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this h@@ oll@@ er .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
spa@@ tial reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
people always ask me , what are you resear@@ ching in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of all the time ?
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ stes are pump@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him on his way .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks are not in the middle east .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost profi@@ le .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fix@@ ed on the bottom .
rec@@ ession . de@@ fau@@ lt . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last for six years .
over time , we concent@@ rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it produ@@ ces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
so let me now introdu@@ ce to you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ rier .
you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t say that , because that would be a little poli@@ tically in@@ cor@@ rect .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
thank you for sc@@ aring the living da@@ y@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ ph .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be cli@@ ma@@ te@@ -@@ positive .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
his sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; d getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pl@@ asia .
and rather than having economic shu@@ t@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic inje@@ ction ever .
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching const@@ it@@ u@@ tional crisis .
the act of kin@@ dness she not@@ ed above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put up online .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
we bran@@ ch off of a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
at the time i was as@@ sig@@ ned to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
and you really have to stay pretty fir@@ m while doing so , but i think it &apos;s it &apos;s possible .
no , not because i &apos;m some self ##AT##-##AT## @@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ od@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
a woman in germany s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws about six point three kil@@ os of li@@ p@@ stick in her lifetime .
and part of the narra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to re@@ lie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
you want butt@@ on fly or zi@@ pp@@ er fly ? you want st@@ one@@ was@@ hed or aci@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ was@@ hed ?
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
so you don &apos;t need to ab@@ sta@@ in from listening to classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
and she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of this aspe@@ ct in our narra@@ tives of human evolution .
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic . &quot;
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mira@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
i &apos;d like to explain that a little more .
you sense that that <<unk>> s the actual truth behind the sentence .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christ@@ mas was this one .
early after@@ noon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the lo@@ gic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ it@@ able .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
twice in one emergen@@ cy shift , i mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
he &apos;s ab@@ und@@ ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
he &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
it takes co2 to me@@ than@@ e using molecular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
we &apos;ve tried various approach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to mini@@ mal components .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it requi@@ red enormous planning .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
and if we have ab@@ und@@ ant energy , we also have ab@@ und@@ ant water .
the woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it didn &apos;t look anything like her .
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it .
and we think we &apos;re prote@@ cting the environment when we do a little less damage .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
well to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
what we musi@@ cians do with our musical language is very alien to non ##AT##-##AT## @@ profession@@ als .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
the conclu@@ sion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by machin@@ ery .
but even if you imple@@ ment these indi@@ cations , it still just rema@@ ins something technical .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
made all these films , made all these docum@@ ent@@ ary films for a very limited audience .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communic@@ ating .
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and orange is wire .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
they can express their opini@@ on on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , nei@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
well , at se@@ vent@@ e@@ en you still have dreams , but no significant memor@@ ies .
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavi@@ oral change .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analog@@ ous to sex . &quot;
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intui@@ tive ?
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near the ent@@ r@@ ance of the store .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conc@@ ei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
so here , we have a young female and a male enga@@ ged in a ch@@ ase game .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ tors , which would be prop@@ he@@ t .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
and so when i started travel@@ ing and going to these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
re@@ bec@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensor@@ s stopped working .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
this en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
the second story , also to illu@@ strate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wa@@ i@@ st@@ line .
and that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ entation was , how to reach one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the par@@ king lot outside of his hospital .
and it got to the essen@@ ce , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
my opini@@ on is that the mo@@ s@@ sad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
that means our entire intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automo@@ bile factory .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
when countries get together in places like cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ uss the co2 .
did you get a second or third opini@@ on , as people call it so ni@@ c@@ ely no@@ wa@@ days ?
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the penguins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once pain@@ ted a portra@@ it of a woman .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
she saved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teachers &apos; lo@@ un@@ ge .
i had the great privi@@ lege , when i was a young law@@ yer , of meeting ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , intri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possibility .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way each time .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;ll ever be .
i have had the distin@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever cho@@ se farmer .
in another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ?
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
and nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distin@@ ct ...
it consi@@ sts of tw@@ ent@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ six member countries that control for@@ ty percent of all the oil de@@ pos@@ its .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and they were always magni@@ fi@@ cent , because the dan@@ cers were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the dies@@ el system , if the price of dies@@ el ris@@ es by five percent a year .
usually , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mira@@ cle by a certain date .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
that made the whole thing consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
we &apos;d only be able to flo@@ at in the earth &apos;s se@@ as as am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line .
they were all called k@@ f@@ as at the time , the place in j@@ ü@@ lich was also called a k@@ f@@ a .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu@@ p@@ ils .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fi@@ cs , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psych@@ ed out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating it increasingly quick@@ er and better , for example .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , ju@@ stin bie@@ ber , got his start on youtube .
what &apos;s left is story@@ telling .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
serve food at a sou@@ p kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
i would like to talk to you about why many e ##AT##-##AT## @@ health projects fail .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ cate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
you were you were invited to dinner , not to ste@@ al nutri@@ ents .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le sent@@ ences for children .
this super@@ computer was called the global extin@@ ction awareness system , of course .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
but when i cho@@ se a career as an adult , it was film@@ making .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , i think it comes down to planning .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in dec@@ ember we met in mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
here i have a very complicated , mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dra@@ matic increase in fir@@ es .
and she felt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her feet .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p , called citizens connect .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see , these are re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control systems .
that means we &apos;re losing five ##AT##-##AT## @@ thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
a lie like that shows you that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is enter@@ ing our everyday objects .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
i guess what kind of gen@@ re , style i am would be like dark glam@@ or .
and then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words i &apos;ve ever heard .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon just last apri@@ l .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limit@@ s of possibility .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ vering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
and i would like to invi@@ te everyone to work on it and event try something y@@ ourselves .
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ sour@@ cing game .
we took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
if i asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
two pa@@ irs of stock@@ ings for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
fe@@ males , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the states .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no exc@@ use for failure .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
of bee@@ tho@@ ven we know that he listen@@ ed more once he &apos;d already gone dea@@ f .
with so many op@@ tions to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
so this is a story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the mi@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it ble@@ e@@ ds it leads , &quot; is very true .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er ##AT##-##AT## @@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dry day .
in a spli@@ t second , i lost all sen@@ sation and movement below my p@@ el@@ v@@ is .
and because i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
in the united states , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
which i would very much re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a lo@@ vely , communic@@ ative thing .
and they found that the average ce@@ o enga@@ ged in about 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in a week .
o@@ .@@ k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
and i got a big sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
and si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ ni@@ ty .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
so tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
in california there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the si@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ pack .
but gradu@@ ally the written form became the primary medium , and ga@@ ined a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ nis@@ h addi@@ tional information about her .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that must be respe@@ cted by law .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
that &apos;s why com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ end on us interpre@@ ters to rein@@ vent the pieces again and again .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
the politics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i do not mean foot@@ ball .
you see , sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resour@@ ce ##AT##-##AT## @@ liber@@ ating force .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
and so , recently , scientists have suggest@@ ed that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
i think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
we ad@@ just our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there .
now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning dete@@ ctor , our dan@@ ger dete@@ ctor .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worl@@ ds .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al ##AT##-##AT## @@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ?
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
and so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ?
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tou@@ g@@ her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res@@ ig@@ ned themselves to what was happening .
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
that means the first impres@@ sion comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we percei@@ ve things .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe did lots of development projects .
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stron@@ ger than the white p@@ ill .
working with universi@@ ties all over sub ##AT##-##AT## @@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are invi@@ ting them to learn social innovation skills .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul@@ tane@@ ously the media produ@@ cer and medium .
all one &apos;s own music is destro@@ yed because you &apos;re constantly being bom@@ bar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself .
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
it might be the evolutionary orig@@ in of the phr@@ ase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the ball@@ s . &quot;
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
but the concep@@ ts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
i mean , how many of you saw the w@@ inning of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by ib@@ m &apos;s wat@@ son ?
and the reality of that expression reach@@ es all of us and moves us , in@@ spir@@ es and un@@ ites us .
and when you have one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then it &apos;s like a self ##AT##-##AT## @@ suff@@ i@@ cient system .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ on@@ gst this tech@@ ie , ge@@ e@@ ky internet culture .
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ x@@ ed fit ?
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant sets of vac@@ cin@@ es .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really color@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
in fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much sha@@ ped the way she saw the world .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intui@@ tive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries in all of europe . &quot;
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fis@@ m -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time ever in human history .
we can &apos;t just do that .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become something alien to us
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on about progress .
i need you to go up@@ sta@@ irs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
climate skep@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the com@@ pos@@ er at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
by the way , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts electrical out@@ put on dies@@ el fuel basis is ad@@ ded in the world per year .
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
the brand that i am is , i would call it cas@@ ual fly .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
we need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chap@@ ter of mo@@ bility .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
but at the time multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ed organisms come online , things start to change .
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
vi@@ cious car@@ tel@@ s . announ@@ cer five : cau@@ stic cru@@ ise lines .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
but what i wo@@ und up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
there &apos;s been this huge dec@@ line in crime in america over the last three decades .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about fe@@ eding chicken to fish ? &quot;
or better : how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ or@@ ing activity happening on the network .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pris@@ ons , on death row .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
and for example , the most sophisti@@ cated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self ##AT##-##AT## @@ de@@ ception , up@@ right .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess .
are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large foot@@ print , which will turn into we@@ t@@ land .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an is .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are conne@@ cting to the global conversation .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e ##AT##-##AT## @@ maker .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ relevant .
the day before the event , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
the second major group of attac@@ kers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
instead of pus@@ hing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
because with pig@@ s , phosp@@ hor@@ us is rele@@ ased in their soli@@ d components fa@@ e@@ ces .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution .
and if you want the ulti@@ mate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the need@@ le .
if they get surro@@ unded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
but how is it with with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x ##AT##-##AT## @@ in@@ ch layer on top .
and after , as i refle@@ cted on that , i decided to elimin@@ ate negative energy from my life .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without ar@@ med gu@@ ards .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstra@@ cting out .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
and it creates this kind of social network around a colle@@ ction of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this glo@@ be .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ grown fl@@ es@@ h .
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut fore@@ sts .
they help in the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gress .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not sc@@ ary .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the admini@@ stration of crimin@@ al justice .
at the end of each day , i made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up and pl@@ us ##AT##-##AT## @@ one strength , and pl@@ us ##AT##-##AT## @@ one intelligence .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ ster@@ ing toler@@ ance .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechan@@ ical quant@@ um super@@ position .
now you might think that all this break@@ ing ##AT##-##AT## @@ down of categ@@ ories would make somebody like me really happy .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
these are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ matically less than a power plant .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
a tv or a was@@ hing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t exp@@ end them .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat that ro@@ tten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ va for instance .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run@@ -@@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ the ##AT##-##AT## @@ mil@@ l electro@@ chemical battery .
the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and cla@@ w .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the ##AT##-##AT## @@ record conversation . &quot;
if you put you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choo@@ sing .
that means it takes fif@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one po@@ und of farm tun@@ a .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electr@@ on@@ ics .
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ li@@ sh it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l ##AT##-##AT## @@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the pa@@ pers is what you find in this third theor@@ em .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
another example from a very different field . mon@@ et pain@@ ted his water@@ li@@ lies an infin@@ ite number of times .
because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ und@@ ant , before it gets extin@@ ct , it becomes rare .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
and i would please like the record to refle@@ ct today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build c@@ ameras and lights and all kinds of things .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
and this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations sha@@ ping a new life together .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
now i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ scale stories .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our c@@ ameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
in in china a a cham@@ ber po@@ t is still called a hon@@ ey po@@ t , you could say , right ?
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
you see , there are two countries that control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ vo@@ irs worldwide .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
something as dra@@ matic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
how do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fres@@ hn@@ ess , more fres@@ hn@@ ess , three times fres@@ her .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ini@@ zing hor@@ m@@ one .
so by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- wo@@ of !
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
and so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ oral fusion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
when i was a child , i had multiple colle@@ ctions of sti@@ cks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and sh@@ ells .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
for her , life had dist@@ ill@@ ed itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in australia .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ c to these arch@@ a@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with virtu@@ ality .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 50@@ 0 ##AT##-##AT## @@ degre@@ e ##AT##-##AT## @@ centi@@ grade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from myster@@ y science theater was one of the first people to post a jo@@ ke about the video on twitter .
so through this mode of pas@@ sing on the bur@@ den of pro@@ ving something you are experi@@ en@@ cing the brilli@@ ance of the lie .
already in some s@@ hal@@ low la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ than@@ e is ac@@ tively bub@@ bling up out of the water .
in both cases , these are gro@@ ss under@@ esti@@ mates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
and also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a lo@@ g cur@@ ve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
so , for better or for worse , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wid@@ ely read children &apos;s auth@@ or , in fact .
fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . police pe@@ pp@@ er spra@@ y .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
making it differently or pre@@ t@@ tier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physi@@ cally , the european one .
we had the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , we have had the machine age and we are now ste@@ pping into the so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called cy@@ ber age .
we have life im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this country .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness here .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
and half of the wa@@ ste@@ water problem worldwide is caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
yet i am afraid of privi@@ lege , of e@@ ase , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ zens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now when i was a fres@@ h@@ man in college , i took my first biology class .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaning@@ ful work .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myster@@ y .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
i brought along an example of the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
why not have the quick twi@@ tch muscle that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del@@ ved into it more .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gold@@ man would study for a blood test .
so given a do@@ zen news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with bes@@ i@@ des your existence as a designer .
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to explore the answer , by building si@@ ft@@ ables .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real living space .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people ele@@ cted to office .
i can speed up the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our imagination .
this is called a law of design or gest@@ alt psychology , which in turn affec@@ ts our perception .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re te@@ sted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
they will say , a person who has no sou@@ l is dead and can &apos;t cla@@ im anything .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introdu@@ ction , i must say .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cre@@ am wra@@ pping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ar@@ ise .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the des@@ cent of man .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hop@@ eless can@@ di@@ date .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
unfortunately not the one on offen@@ b@@ ach , but perhaps you can give the frank@@ fur@@ ters a hand .
that &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and this refer@@ end@@ um would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement and safety .
and police off@@ ic@@ ers were coming in and assi@@ stant pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and c@@ ler@@ k workers .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half of their size .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ a@@ tics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ a@@ tics at all .
which is great , because the roman@@ s did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly clever individual .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ cker@@ y . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
that also const@@ it@@ utes the entertain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
because it &apos;s in that ne@@ x@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they followed ce@@ os around for a whole week .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a travel@@ ing wave re@@ actor .
so , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow .
we made an app@@ lic@@ ation for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
it is almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
the vi@@ ral particles then were rele@@ ased from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limit@@ s on screen real e@@ state .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifest@@ yle .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rect all the er@@ r@@ ors .
that means we all share a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
and i finally decided , oh go@@ sh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
so we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite distin@@ ct .
well i ad@@ or@@ ed my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friend@@ ly , so that anybody can use it ?
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the ex@@ ception of my physical therapy s@@ essi@@ ons .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
people wra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
we can see it again here we can see the dies@@ el again here , and all the individual ag@@ gre@@ gates here .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
if you are surro@@ unding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
evolution is all about pas@@ sing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
there &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
so doing things like this -- you know , re@@ mind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
that might sound m@@ und@@ an@@ e at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
over@@ view : i &apos;m inter@@ acting with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om back out , zo@@ om in .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay choo@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self ##AT##-##AT## @@ interest .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then aug@@ ments my strength and en@@ dur@@ ance .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of creativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
but if you immer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next century .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ f@@ i works .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and this is why .
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
we do need the market in@@ centi@@ ves -- co2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since laun@@ ch .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the arc@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe rec@@ order .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p ##AT##-##AT## @@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
the human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predic@@ tors , you can &apos;t prove that .
well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; trial and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
but every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ scen@@ dent .
in offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , tw@@ ent@@ y percent of the amount of waste produced by hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds consi@@ sts of na@@ pp@@ ies .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get pro@@ of , you need to accept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
i &apos;m talking about the sou@@ l .
we know that something else is really true .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expres@@ sed more .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fi@@ ction , i know .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; the harv@@ est@@ ers &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ gel at the met .
i would like to explain this mechan@@ ism to you today and make it a little more acc@@ essi@@ ble to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an un@@ conscious level .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
when profess@@ ors become curious , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ me@@ ster .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th ##AT##-##AT## @@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had phot@@ oli@@ th@@ ograph@@ y .
and it de@@ als with proble@@ m ##AT##-##AT## @@ solving in a play@@ ful , creative , original way .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re dec@@ ei@@ ving yourself .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
so neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
there are contro@@ versi@@ al top@@ ics such as all those gene@@ tically modi@@ fied plants in the fields .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ stra@@ cted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .
because the soil will the mo@@ ss dies and the the wind and water was@@ h away the soil .
and you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dro@@ pped some@@ place .
so as a citi@@ zen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
it is about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about her life .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non ##AT##-##AT## @@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
and yes , the discussion always revol@@ ves around how much of the future you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docum@@ ent@@ aries .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
every year we lose about three ton@@ nes of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which should really be cir@@ cul@@ ated .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
and every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the chemicals within them .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
but not only that -- it will integra@@ te and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graph@@ y of the glo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
to these non ##AT##-##AT## @@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall .
so what could three billion ris@@ ing , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time control systems .
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
if you have 10 teams that typically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ und@@ ance that no one could have ever predi@@ cted .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
so this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not contain@@ ed within any one wikipedia page .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
in h@@ oll@@ and it &apos;s easier to understand this , because h@@ oll@@ and built the country on flo@@ wers .
if we can do that , then instead of being tra@@ pped in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
when a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ ver@@ sity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vi@@ ral and then why that even matters .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explan@@ ation of what we &apos;re about to see .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
but dan@@ ny , the whole american en@@ dea@@ vor is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
so the capacity to play in prototyp@@ e is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams per@@ form .
right now in al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
when i turn up in my little v@@ w cl@@ un@@ ker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
while any@@ time i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vac@@ cin@@ es for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
well , since the film pre@@ mi@@ ered at the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , let &apos;s take a look .
and that &apos;s why it is so stron@@ g@@ ly ro@@ ot@@ ed in us , this ability to deal with virtu@@ ality .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
here you have to keep another philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a philosop@@ hi@@ cal slo@@ w ##AT##-##AT## @@ bur@@ ner , close to hand .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing ##AT##-##AT## @@ water temper@@ atures .
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular jo@@ es .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
through my work i &apos;m trying to artic@@ u@@ late that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the ted@@ talk .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to ada@@ pt .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the w@@ inning team and the prime minister at the time .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
going back to my actual top@@ ic natural user interface and the top@@ ic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course .
there &apos;s also an extra associ@@ ation , the cra@@ d@@ le ##AT##-##AT## @@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ cra@@ d@@ le ##AT##-##AT## @@ institute , where everybody can get involved .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
the next slide i show you will be a ra@@ pid fa@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of k@@ ie@@ v in u@@ kra@@ ine .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contribu@@ ting to bio@@ diversity .
ad@@ ver@@ sity isn &apos;t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
and imagine if you would a@@ .@@ i@@ . &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
sure , i will have thro@@ wn some colors away too , but i will have ad@@ ded new ones to take their place .
you have to be able to c@@ ater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one f@@ at@@ al fla@@ w , and that fla@@ w was this .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay .
perhaps you could just brie@@ fly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
because it &apos;s a tra@@ v@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
if you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it reach@@ es the sea .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
in r@@ wand@@ a , even after the geno@@ cide , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
that i can suddenly that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is becoming increasingly ir@@ relevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an app@@ lic@@ ation .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rect answer .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pel the video to be as popular as it would become .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion machin@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding proteins than the best computers .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
and so , we started planning these and we wo@@ und up going to the bis@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehi@@ cles .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ oles@@ ome . &quot;
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ te@@ ent@@ h
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
spec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of at@@ las under construction so you can see the scale .
even better , it was far@@ m ##AT##-##AT## @@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
i was just asked whether this s@@ ack is a talking s@@ ack and will talk for me .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
i decided that rele@@ asing fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fi@@ ction movie .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
can i hand@@ le it directly or do i need a man@@ ual or a cor@@ respon@@ dent training .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stor@@ es .
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , bio@@ ha@@ cking de@@ als with modern molecular biology .
i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the nat@@ anz ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facili@@ ty .
but when combin@@ ing photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not se@@ ttle into a career in law .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing .
and with that you can acceler@@ ate the particles stron@@ g@@ ly enough and then they enter the oni@@ ons .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
its flexi@@ ble design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high ##AT##-##AT## @@ agi@@ li@@ ty mov@@ ements .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old children to die in prison .
are you establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pa@@ thetic like the op@@ ra@@ h ?
vis@@ it@@ ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel@@ met .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot;
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already reti@@ red before i finally started studying .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
we are ready with our industry partner to introdu@@ ce this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
she remin@@ ded me that i was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
this is an example of how adults in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
so , here we were making docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper i could .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an in this , you know it .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related spa@@ tially in this way .
and any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosp@@ hor@@ us .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worl@@ ds and not the real world .
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been jo@@ ining my side in the last couple of years .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change oc@@ curr@@ ing in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives pro@@ posed .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ c@@ tively better .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish i had the night before .
i first went to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opport@@ une moment when i can take care of you .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental nor we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ sto@@ m make your car .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self ##AT##-##AT## @@ bio@@ - d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g , di@@ y bi@@ o .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
and he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ oning him in his sleep .
then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ formed into understanding , a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and gra@@ ce .
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means the water will re@@ main in the field for longer .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get sel@@ ec@@ ted out .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the la@@ p of our parents .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to de@@ plo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do .
it also needs -- it needs dig@@ ni@@ ty , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her cas@@ ket .
and because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contain@@ ed within a single mar@@ ble .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the dem@@ ands that i made on myself .
they are fru@@ strated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
our organis@@ m has come up with an exc@@ ell@@ ent method to make un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy simply disappe@@ ar .
now you probably think that the com@@ pos@@ er , when writing down the notes , already inclu@@ des everything they &apos;ve thought of .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appe@@ ared in this issue , the spor@@ ts .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter -- fir@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ gra@@ der , not much arti@@ stic talent ...
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ es . &quot;
because you project an assu@@ mption that you &apos;re seeing something you re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise to the front , such as a circle .
if i had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and rele@@ ased it in the room .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es can take over the entire network .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
in a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ planes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
the mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
it just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able expec@@ tations about performance .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announ@@ ced , the next building block .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand ton@@ nes of ur@@ ani@@ um was put onto our fields in germany .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
and those other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attra@@ ctive .
it would be easy to just throw a li@@ tr@@ e of waste oil onto it and the p@@ lot would be ru@@ ined for years .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
because ta@@ ste@@ makers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel introdu@@ ce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
well that ori@@ entation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be enga@@ ged in .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the austr@@ ali@@ an ab@@ origin@@ als .
but usually i have an ac@@ cess@@ ory , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or i like cr@@ y@@ st@@ al and things like that too .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , then we can p@@ lot our brain .
that &apos;s why all western emp@@ ires just kept on exp@@ and@@ ing until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they im@@ plo@@ ded .
and that scienti@@ fically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly cor@@ rect , because because we don &apos;t know how much is k@@ is@@ sed away .
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; and see .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s non@@ sense , a play@@ thing for kids , we calcul@@ ated everything , it will never add up .
so no more saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding , re@@ duc@@ ing , no more gu@@ il@@ t management , but intelligent waste .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
this is because , in the mi@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
you see , even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure metal .
i &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ matic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ re@@ ment plans .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o@@ .@@ k. ?
we want to imagine the be@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
it was running into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into .
understanding that these categ@@ ories are really much more un@@ stable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
and then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that apply to the entire sequence .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ strated ever produced .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ards , there &apos;s no po@@ sters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , that is being sha@@ ped by these out@@ comes .
all of na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were f@@ ed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
that humans are supposed to have des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and that , yes , there is at least one ance@@ st@@ or shared by both humans and ap@@ es .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the text@@ book .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , sur@@ ely what charles has written is not true .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
i know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
so we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
now i am also older than ch@@ op@@ in when he wrote the piece at thir@@ t@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ two .
i think the greatest ad@@ ver@@ sity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an to the front .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and if you put it exactly between two equ@@ ally big ha@@ y@@ stac@@ ks , it will star@@ ve .
d@@ k : you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some di@@ visi@@ ons , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
that means that everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , avo@@ i@@ ding , re@@ duc@@ ing .
and you inje@@ ct it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ ft@@ able against a sequence si@@ ft@@ able .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
i or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him and asked my collea@@ gue to reas@@ s@@ ess him .
that was the first re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very clo@@ sely at data and data structures .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ ar aci@@ do@@ sis .
and the pre@@ mis@@ e was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
i have young film@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant , called the surge@@ ons .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fett@@ i can@@ on ball .
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car assem@@ bly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many bi@@ ologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ulti@@ mate respect for an audience .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate auth@@ ority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
it &apos;s the first biological ru@@ ck@@ s@@ ack , truly , that was made to be re@@ turned into the life cycle .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new con@@ ception of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bus@@ he@@ hr nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ anz fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a regular con@@ figu@@ ration in two dimensions .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west for example ?
you see , al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
if we had tw@@ ent@@ y percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
there was a gather@@ ing of resol@@ ve and a quie@@ t voice saying , &quot; i will b@@ yp@@ ass you . &quot;
henry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
they built this intri@@ cate series of can@@ als , and they pus@@ hed water off the land and out into the river .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical di@@ visi@@ ons that make sense to me and that i think we should re@@ tain .
he would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from below and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three ##AT##-##AT## @@ dimensional world .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies out of them .
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m ##AT##-##AT## @@ solving environment .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vi@@ tal organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in ad@@ v@@ ance .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
i brought this project along as an example to illu@@ strate how these arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models are being add@@ ressed again .
i don &apos;t want to say five ##AT##-##AT## @@ year ##AT##-##AT## @@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle things , life is a matter of choice .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
you want boot cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; on and on he went .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with c@@ ameras ready usually .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ po@@ late forward .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gressi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the poor@@ er they get .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the taste , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accu@@ rate .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
if you are a sus@@ pe@@ ct in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be ta@@ pped .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles .
or , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
the stories of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
but now , because the refle@@ ctive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and if you look , for example , in the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
and i want you to see , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is quie@@ tly playing with water .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automo@@ bil@@ es or twitter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
and you can see here too , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from the min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers , and je@@ t@@ blue .
as the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rele@@ asing miner@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ rich fresh water that n@@ our@@ ish@@ es many forms of life .
and that &apos;s not within the range of ama@@ te@@ urs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
that our visi@@ ons of technology and design and entertain@@ ment and creativity have to be married with visi@@ ons of humanity , compassion and justice .
i mean think of it , when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self ##AT##-##AT## @@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive species .
and west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ lands , is particularly ra@@ pid in its mel@@ ting .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gala@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
i was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we need to have this dialo@@ gue be a more rational , more under@@ stand@@ able dialo@@ gue , including the steps that the government takes .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
when we first sequen@@ ced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accu@@ ra@@ cy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attac@@ ks based on the attac@@ kers .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; exc@@ use me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
so i think , in conclu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
and the interesting thing about that is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of regi@@ ons could be de@@ pic@@ ted through songs .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was cho@@ sen as the young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accor@@ d@@ ingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a pool at a y@@ m@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
so half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
and it was my job , when the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f called for a car@@ di@@ ology consu@@ lt , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
not long after@@ wards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
it turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is re@@ lie@@ ved with dies@@ el fuel , because you don &apos;t need a licen@@ se for it .
but if you want to ho@@ ok up several of these power in@@ ver@@ ters and they are supposed to constru@@ ct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
the dies@@ el will be the back@@ -up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated .
so i just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
we have an abstra@@ ct an abstra@@ cted language .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a lin@@ ear fashion .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading liter@@ ature from that period .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predic@@ tors .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swi@@ mming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
that means that if you &apos;re at se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
those who were still around in school , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pped out .
so even while studying , you deal with the top@@ ic of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , testing the sensor@@ s that open the water .
but it &apos;s an essential compon@@ ent , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible .
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participa@@ te than if you only offer five . why ?
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global warming .
part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part broo@@ kl@@ yn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her .
it &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent is made of al@@ umin@@ um .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skep@@ tical .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden lau@@ ghter swa@@ ying the trees .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the span@@ ish .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on janu@@ ary fourth and fif@@ th .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about sla@@ very .
and you can inje@@ ct these sounds into a sequence that you can assem@@ ble into the pattern that you want .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty to prove that there are predic@@ tors .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dis@@ h .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more acc@@ essi@@ ble with technology together .
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
but combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three ##AT##-##AT## @@ dimensional , like it could exist .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurz@@ weil and i started a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ bo@@ u hi@@ de .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of vie@@ ws and becomes a cultural moment .
the roman@@ s had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a geni@@ us .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimu@@ lation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless impli@@ cated .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribution , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
the bottom is trans@@ formed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i &apos;m going to play something that i sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly sto@@ le from c@@ elli@@ sts .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes down by over nin@@ et@@ y percent .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have discus@@ sions with you .
but ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ dation , mar@@ g@@ in@@ alization .
i tell them about terror@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to world war ii .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
so all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
a lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
and chicago just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sha@@ ving machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
i must hon@@ est@@ ly say , and you wit@@ n@@ essed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ air@@ es online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ air@@ es , who made money with their attac@@ ks .
will we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more rob@@ ust and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worl@@ ds than the real world .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choo@@ sing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fresh from the wild .
the point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally fe@@ e@@ ds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a sou@@ p gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
it became a gil@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dra@@ matically .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start sing@@ ing on its own .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ onal reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
today , i play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always trans@@ formed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
we can constru@@ ct si@@ x ##AT##-##AT## @@ and ##AT##-##AT## @@ a ##AT##-##AT## @@ hal@@ f ##AT##-##AT## @@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s britain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time .
i think b@@ ach would have been very enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic if he &apos;d had the ton@@ al possibilities that today &apos;s modern pian@@ os have .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said very ma@@ tter@@ -@@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ fac@@ tly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
see , when you do a google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ishing supply , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resources .
and so when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect re@@ a@@ ders all over the world .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
now there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the usa who &apos;s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ dies@@ el fuel made from al@@ ga@@ e .
i realized at that point , by conne@@ cting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
i met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
we took a look at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gical device within the device .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
but i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
obviously , this is resul@@ ting in some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic back in@@ ju@@ ries .
we now have techniques , because of these ra@@ pid metho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .

she would catch the po@@ em by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us ##AT##-##AT## @@ one speaking , and pl@@ us ##AT##-##AT## @@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us ##AT##-##AT## @@ 20 crazy idea .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutri@@ ents from increasingly distance places .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surge@@ on or physi@@ cian or par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
so after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fi@@ ction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing ves@@ sel .
my state of al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vi@@ ction .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all h@@ arb@@ or@@ ed as children .
and two days later i came to do my next emergen@@ cy shift , and that &apos;s when my ch@@ ie@@ f asked to speak to me quie@@ tly in her office .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la &apos;s invest@@ ing in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
and how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s ##AT##-##AT## @@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
i will cl@@ ari@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attemp@@ t to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtu@@ ality .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
those are the dec@@ lin@@ ing influ@@ ences of the pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial cultures .

here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but used so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called son@@ gl@@ ines , or dre@@ am@@ pa@@ ths
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheel@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and it took place in in co@@ operation with the museum .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , but also in science .
and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like that od@@ d , still@@ -@@ scre@@ aming bear .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ c@@ tively , and we feel worse .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating compon@@ ent .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
several years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot conc@@ ei@@ ve because the bas@@ eline has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
and this resul@@ ted in the first soft@@ -@@ surface character , c@@ g anima@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
henry , by contr@@ ast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch 1 , 19@@ 80 .
so we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that pers@@ ist that are in many ways proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able .
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ stra@@ pped schools all across america .
and what does intui@@ tive mean and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of perception work and how does cognitive process@@ ing work ?
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutri@@ ents .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you considered political as@@ yl@@ um instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
imagine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
and it was expres@@ s@@ ly designed to en@@ able me to discover the outside world , to re@@ discover the real world .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many do@@ ors there are .
so if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
we &apos;ve done a really good job strug@@ gling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choo@@ sing one thing , you &apos;re choo@@ sing not to do other things .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern spa@@ in , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experiment@@ al equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
so the ancient artist was prote@@ cted from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partner@@ ship between those percei@@ ved de@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
there was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and dar@@ ing .
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange a@@ qua@@ tic plants .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we re@@ duced it down to a little sum@@ mary .
we pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ cked them for the three years since .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
in one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufacturing de@@ fe@@ ct .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vor@@ s of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a direc@@ ted attack .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot outside his home in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is carrying an x chromo@@ some , meeting the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up .
we have trouble fe@@ eding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medi@@ cin@@ es , fuel for the six and a half billion .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergen@@ cy medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , so i decided to change that .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same hei@@ ght and in the same type of light .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another s@@ hal@@ low la@@ ke last winter .
now the engineers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use the lie as a gran@@ dio@@ se invention to stabili@@ ze our living conditions .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
my mother , ma@@ i , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two small girls .
and the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of choo@@ sing .
and i studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; res@@ iden@@ ce at tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here .
and the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
we took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
i just see it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alterna@@ te reality .
and i went sa@@ il@@ ing on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the ja@@ va sea .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swi@@ mming po@@ ol@@ -@@ sha@@ ped hole underneath the device .
if you complete the game you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social inno@@ v@@ ator , class of 2010 .
now i will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challen@@ ging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of participa@@ tion went down two percent .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty s@@ her@@ i@@ ff who was offen@@ ded that the jan@@ it@@ or had come into court .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an opportunity to affect one .
now we can come up with the second theor@@ em and say : if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , then he has no free will .
okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
with time , you will have dem@@ ands and will want to have more sp@@ ices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ h@@ ill ski@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the sp@@ an of milli@@ seconds in which these things happen .
and if they &apos;re on a smar@@ t@@ phone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
all those things ste@@ mm@@ ed and started from one place , and for me they ste@@ mm@@ ed and started with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
and so you have someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , saying : there is nothing more important than stabili@@ sing the human population .
the so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and listen@@ ed to the mov@@ ements of my grandmother around the house .
but in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these a@@ e@@ ds .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
i had a great education -- i &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these muse@@ ums and these art@@ works .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you cho@@ se .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they com@@ mit , but do we deser@@ ve to kill ?
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophisti@@ cated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
not , if i am environ@@ ment@@ ally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environ@@ ment@@ ally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a contain@@ er , i can directly see which one con@@ tains s@@ alt and which one con@@ tains pe@@ pp@@ er .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e ##AT##-##AT## @@ play from .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consci@@ ously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instin@@ c@@ tively in part .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
the question is , what will come next ?
i have this cognitive feedback , you proje@@ cted something you want to see .
arch@@ a@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted in pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial times .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ i@@ stic thought in one 18 minute speech .
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
and then se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ g@@ ged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resi@@ stance .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identity .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
but the point is to always find a a really loo@@ se approach to it , to deal with it play@@ fully .
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
that was really intui@@ tive , i mean , everyone expres@@ sed their wi@@ sh@@ es , their and things that move them .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise i won &apos;t convince my audience that this is my desire .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
this device has the ability to be in a quant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epi@@ c win .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edi@@ tion , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants wei@@ gh four times as much a people .
if the tra@@ de ##AT##-##AT## @@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gues us .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this thing was .
around christ@@ mas , in my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for mana@@ gers to come in , and also an ex@@ ternal legal system .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in ad@@ v@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ sor and an actu@@ ator .
and one of the things we did at rad@@ b@@ oud university is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a ch@@ ie@@ f listening off@@ ic@@ er .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
we &apos;re more on the symbo@@ lic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with .
i car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ sta@@ irs where i met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the pre@@ cious dog by the front door .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communic@@ ates in a li@@ vely way .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we are on a planet that is ba@@ th@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally com@@ mit su@@ i@@ cide seem to be really und@@ one by their gif@@ ts , you know .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively gra@@ b it and then pass me the s@@ alt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .
in the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two ##AT##-##AT## @@ dimensional surface .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ et@@ ration of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volu@@ me si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely repor@@ ted that people assu@@ me that mo@@ s@@ sad is the main enti@@ ty behind this .

you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or bee@@ f c@@ attle .
i get the entire over@@ view , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
and on this cur@@ ve , ri@@ ding on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different an@@ gles .
le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .

he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the earth .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ a@@ ther on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twi@@ t@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bur@@ y them yet .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
if you just take these these na@@ pp@@ ies , sh@@ red them , ster@@ ili@@ ze them and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees with it .
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , in@@ c . right ?
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , bi@@ ologi@@ cally , except in terms of when he was born .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us rather than having a geni@@ us .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sau@@ lt me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
by cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cra@@ d@@ le to the gra@@ ve , then our our entire planet will become a ce@@ me@@ tery so@@ on@@ er or later .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
we do achieve more in game worl@@ ds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed a couple things .
so , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amo@@ unts to no less than a mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to virtual worl@@ ds and online game environments . &quot;
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educ@@ ated and healthy .
today i &apos;d like to verb@@ ally trans@@ late what i usually trans@@ late into music , or interpre@@ t .
today a modern orche@@ str@@ a can play anything that was re@@ je@@ cted as un@@ play@@ able at the time .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteri@@ stic that can &apos;t be learned .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cle@@ aner than when it enter@@ ed .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could imple@@ ment a reser@@ vo@@ ir wi@@ sely today .
so , for the next worl@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ saving game , we decided to a@@ im higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ world problems .
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human lau@@ ghter , dance and ritual .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the acade@@ mic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there .
we can start integr@@ ating electro@@ -@@ mo@@ bility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
every language is an ol@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wir@@ es can take that current .
with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours .
he transl@@ ated the water@@ li@@ lies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wir@@ es .
it is very difficult to think straight about well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tr@@ as@@ h@@ can behind the house .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
or photos like these -- both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ alism .
is it logi@@ cal that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
my circle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o where i was the class que@@ er .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the acade@@ mic world .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
and then you ask them how they establi@@ sh their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
sh@@ am@@ ans , p@@ rie@@ sts , so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called kee@@ pers of knowledge , were speci@@ ally as@@ sig@@ ned to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , kind of thing .
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing d@@ res@@ s ##AT##-##AT## @@ up , or that i re@@ mind them of their se@@ ven@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed ste@@ ad@@ y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
and the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
if you don &apos;t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ -@@ chemistry .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self kee@@ ps for us .
computer ha@@ cking , and then in the media it &apos;s yes , ha@@ ck@@ ers break into a place and ste@@ al data and so on .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mm@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
and at that stage , we have multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fi@@ ction influence , as a kid .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
an epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achie@@ ved it .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
and that era of terror@@ ism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of ra@@ cial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ ti@@ ments of george bur@@ ns , who was per@@ forming still in las v@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this glo@@ be , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
some of you might remember , it was it@@ al@@ y and fr@@ ance playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt .
and as we &apos;re here in frank@@ fur@@ t am main , i &apos;ll re@@ mind you of the ma@@ x -@@ plan@@ ck@@ -@@ institute for brain research .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of un@@ its of this in the developing world .

i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some metaph@@ or@@ ical fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , disaster .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who ma@@ tter@@ ed .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , in in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories .
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more pre@@ cise , more accu@@ rate and quick@@ er .
so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;m a huge fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
and as i was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and respe@@ cted him .
and so , if you dep@@ end on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
we have very difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions no@@ wa@@ days -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is literally a million times che@@ aper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hop@@ e@@ ful .
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and sho@@ ot a video .
the weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ am@@ ed of such lux@@ u@@ ries .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es we have now .
and so i jum@@ ped in , i jum@@ ped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , house of natural fi@@ bers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ ra@@ power , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , then you will no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain amount of i@@ d@@ len@@ ess in the network .
just as an asi@@ de , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ e@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ dic@@ ated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
that is for people who can see a marine prote@@ cted area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to res@@ et their bas@@ eline .

and as of today , we would like to introdu@@ ce this , not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ e@@ u , which is what the product is called , but also a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ eting it to my friends .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ ger@@ ies is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
i can trans@@ fer this performance model ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act to an interaction system .
and charles ken@@ ny that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expres@@ sed by the com@@ pos@@ er themselves .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
i &apos;m just going to very brie@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attemp@@ t to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tures .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapi@@ dly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zero .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this issue .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
i have friends who make great big , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like i make .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily fa@@ vor the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gras@@ ping .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .

a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned posi@@ tively or nega@@ tively on twitter .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m the trends man@@ ager at youtube , and i profession@@ ally watch youtube videos .

and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called black@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any i talked about pres@@ ented itself .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to ted .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk a@@ verse , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be reward challen@@ ged .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes ; there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
so i sig@@ ned the dis@@ charge pa@@ pers , and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce came , par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs came to take her home .

it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it contra@@ cts in summer .
we try to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but the point is to have a big foot@@ print that &apos;s of use .
and very importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
we all use it , and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly toler@@ ant society where f@@ at@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .

i &apos;d completely closed the loo@@ p between being the science fi@@ ction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
the question is just , calcu@@ late that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
to this day , they re@@ main rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electr@@ on@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its as a material .
that means i can trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f ##AT##-##AT## @@ time job .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us car@@ ries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i de@@ f@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit to you that it makes me nervous .
i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analog@@ ous to when sing@@ le ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ed organisms were turning into multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ed organisms .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at her@@ self in the mirror every day and said , who is the fa@@ i@@ rest of them all ?
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
the tough thing is building the pilot re@@ actor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .

sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flo@@ wer and then tag it .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
he is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ an@@ ced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
and these are not characteri@@ stics of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertain@@ ment of the future .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , and what does that mean fundament@@ ally .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually add@@ ressed to me .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dru@@ cker was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital where i was working .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or so , whereas whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers cost about fif@@ ty euro@@ s .
they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent@@ a@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
so i spoke out on you@@ th un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment and education and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
and if i say to someone , pass me the s@@ alt or the pe@@ pp@@ er , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
my obje@@ ctive is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , for@@ ty years of the ##AT##-##AT## @@ clu@@ b@@ -@@ of ##AT##-##AT## @@ ro@@ me , into quality .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when i was yo@@ unger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and fe@@ males in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
so after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegan@@ t way , if i know this phenomenon .
and , of course , the he@@ art@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
i was raised in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia to believe those fore@@ sts exi@@ sted to be cut .
so imagine one heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chr@@ ony .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less participa@@ tion rate .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of metal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge .
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drin@@ king g@@ in at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to go there .
and in this other image at the top i have a lec@@ ture in in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen at the medical mus@@ ei@@ on in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the top@@ ic .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter@@ parts , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
so , in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
people who have never sung con@@ sequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a t@@ one .
while chimpanze@@ es are domin@@ ated by big , sc@@ ary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ males .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any inten@@ tion of building a wall .
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a best@@ s@@ eller on the men@@ u .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
and during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we ad@@ ded one little thing .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and it &apos;s just standard sele@@ ction : we can sele@@ ct for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , v@@ acc@@ ine production , etc .
we &apos;ve been given over ten million fund@@ ed projects , also to atta@@ ch a ten@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ watt battery to the ger@@ man network .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the fish .
any time i &apos;m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine cab@@ in@@ et , you will see ban de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
that means that once a child has reach@@ ed the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life recei@@ ving stories .
i feel like i had been held under@@ water , and someone finally reach@@ ed down and pulled my head up so i could brea@@ the . &quot;
because while you are bus@@ y telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predic@@ tors , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and relatively naturally .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; a@@ in &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
i was be@@ tting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
those are the people who are at least offi@@ cially regi@@ ster@@ ed on the website , the di@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g ##AT##-##AT## @@ website .
working with il@@ m , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come a@@ par@@ thei@@ d without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
so i told my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot;
and that &apos;s become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , well , infrastructure cent@@ r@@ es , which are being repres@@ ented all over the world .
and i put in my motion that there was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor@@ ial mis@@ condu@@ ct and police mis@@ condu@@ ct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ condu@@ ct .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and self ##AT##-##AT## @@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures .
our system isn &apos;t just being sha@@ ped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ matically .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inje@@ ct this into a patient ...
these notes are about as pre@@ cise or im@@ pre@@ cise as the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely pre@@ cise .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on jun@@ e 1 , 19@@ 80 .
so you have to exam@@ ine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be impro@@ ved too .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three ##AT##-##AT## @@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the me@@ al until you need to use the toi@@ let .
and he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
and yes , well , i &apos;d just like to motiv@@ ate you , in the sense that it &apos;s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
there are other services like how we make ferti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
&quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dri@@ ll into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fis@@ her@@ s and this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and none of it has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effect .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
let me be clear about it . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ dul@@ um , which has an out@@ put of something like one hundred watt per square me@@ tr@@ e , that was a to@@ y .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of metal is in two different places .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
so , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the hori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pres@@ um@@ p@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allo@@ wing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
one day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
now nei@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ com@@ men@@ d for people when you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing their future financial well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being .
every single thing we eat , every grain of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relev@@ ance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upp@@ er air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day , at the ex@@ act same moment , each conc@@ ei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
he put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it kni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
now , that s@@ hal@@ low history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ nia .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relationship with this work .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
direct adverti@@ sing , and not necessarily for the company pu@@ ma , but to help this company make these products successful .
soc@@ rates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar called je@@ an bu@@ ri@@ dan , and bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass was named after him .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transpor@@ tation , communication have dro@@ pped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0 ##AT##-##AT## @@ fold .
i was the guy be@@ aten up b@@ loo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , which which the electric u@@ tili@@ ty on the island , said they think it &apos;s great .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on .
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing ##AT##-##AT## @@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasi@@ on i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
i could also mention ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the usa nobody li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there .
so the idea is , beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ s every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fis@@ hed .
but this is also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participa@@ te when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is characteri@@ zed by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s that &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more acc@@ essi@@ ble .
so to make this blin@@ k faster or slo@@ wer , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that three ##AT##-##AT## @@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year yo@@ unger .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w ##AT##-##AT## @@ away ment@@ ality .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ stige to be able to do that .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compare them to .
that pos@@ es the question as to what is actually the most intui@@ tive performance sche@@ me that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or both .
in the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist eastern germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was bush s@@ lan@@ ders and then people actually got to art .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and te@@ ar , when they break , they can go into biological life cy@@ cles .
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the yo@@ unger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can aug@@ ment it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us che@@ fs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
but because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks re@@ cep@@ tors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspe@@ cts of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reach@@ ing , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a for@@ um , where you where people can meet and disc@@ uss things online .
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ rus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions are going to be refle@@ cted by us as opportunity costs .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
by not partici@@ p@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .

the funny thing was , we had to break into the par@@ king lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
you can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
and i cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for c@@ amer@@ on to do &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always requi@@ red of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too over speed , you must open re@@ lief val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
their brain waves were then measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the ro@@ om@@ went swi@@ t@@ ched on .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ lin@@ ess than the trans@@ fer@@ al of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the one of the des@@ k@@ top .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up fore@@ stry , c@@ ement .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olymp@@ ics in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
in the descri@@ ption of my pres@@ entation , it is written that i , as an interpre@@ ter , see myself as a transl@@ ator , in the english sense of the word .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say , acci@@ dents .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we gu@@ ard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accor@@ d@@ ingly .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
and then you see that even something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ c@@ test organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c waste to be re@@ turned .
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
some people who have x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cular tissue wra@@ pped around it .
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster , because after they stabili@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and i hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new a@@ partment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facili@@ t@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaning@@ ful , but if you &apos;re a com@@ passionate teacher , they can be especially meaning@@ ful .
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra@@ g@@ matic at@@ titude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge ##AT##-##AT## @@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ page , but at a higher level of abstra@@ ction .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 .
because now you can imple@@ ment a rule of three .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ mit@@ s .
well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to off@@ ering people more and more choices .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fir@@ es as the assi@@ stant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
now that &apos;s more impres@@ sive when you consider those magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i found a few things .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that li@@ p@@ stick is totally in@@ efficient , but very effective , you see ?
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out .
and i simply assu@@ me that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the whole world for the next thir@@ ty years .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
adap@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to rock clim@@ b and even hand@@ cycle .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
and then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
one day , los angeles times colum@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
when pro@@ ctor &amp; gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; shoul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for re@@ moving the dan@@ ger that others create when they set a fire .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vier and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it res@@ on@@ ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
they cut out the midd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agen@@ cies and said , &quot; maybe these agen@@ cies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
it &apos;s completely non ##AT##-##AT## @@ invasi@@ ve , sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
number one , how smo@@ oth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , rec@@ ession , depression and bo@@ om time .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice stat@@ ements were made , which i also was part of .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ resol@@ ution experience .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , green@@ land .
that whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier which will be hydro@@ gen me@@ than@@ e , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be .
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents ?
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and that matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
and i go to the ja@@ il and i see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
even though choo@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in apri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
i call it ne@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and cho@@ sen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user inter@@ faces .
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upp@@ er ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing in@@ sur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious br@@ ands .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every confidence it will , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will de@@ plo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
if i invi@@ te you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a p@@ ill with offen@@ b@@ ach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
when i found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the worst days of her life .
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation over the cent@@ u@@ ries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpo@@ rate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
and the room got very quie@@ t , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syste@@ matic killing of human beings .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the entire film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little c@@ up of coffee or c@@ up of te@@ a and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr@@ s. po@@ sten , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , ster@@ i@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
we &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
but i had the good fortun@@ e to meet him at a very young age , when i was thir@@ te@@ en , and so i always atten@@ ded his cour@@ ses while i was at school .
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and er@@ ror , a lot of user testing , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the bare essen@@ ti@@ als .
and none of these pl@@ ots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fif@@ ty of them in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years , none of these pl@@ ots was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ a@@ ged .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
imagine your your wife is sad , because you up@@ set her , and you turn up with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than down@@ town boston .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our addi@@ ction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
she &apos;s one of the organi@@ z@@ ers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a pres@@ entation and present my idea .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0 ##AT##-##AT## @@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refle@@ ction , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prote@@ ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct , right ?
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be enga@@ ged .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to stab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hell@@ o , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follo@@ ws quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they exi@@ sted ?
these might be cou@@ rier services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the a@@ ed that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
and i understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ five .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the death of our bodies en@@ ters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
if you keep hit@@ ting the de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means i &apos;m losing you .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , nam@@ ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hit@@ ting that de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on over and over and over again .
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like g@@ mail .
one such person who opened do@@ ors for me was my childhood doctor at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , del@@ aware .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty ar@@ is@@ es from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
the process is fe@@ eding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those a@@ part@@ ments and the surro@@ unding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the di@@ stra@@ ctions of construction .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wir@@ eless radio .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through -- abstra@@ cting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , pres@@ enting , process@@ ing information .

i think we would all understand the sen@@ ti@@ ment that woo@@ dy allen expres@@ sed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt out@@ put and can keep up that out@@ put for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
of course , the curi@@ osity , the science compon@@ ent of it -- it was everything . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity , it was imagination .
there is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re ##AT##-##AT## @@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really un@@ ites everybody , is this fascin@@ ation with technology .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;

so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
he had x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment .

based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly describe .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occasi@@ onal inter@@ ruption of the un@@ inten@@ ded forced rus@@ h to the ex@@ it .
and what happened is that we trans@@ fer@@ red the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the the production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ ternal media .
once you &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the com@@ position &apos;s creation .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government offi@@ cial giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll exp@@ and in a similar way and also be simil@@ arly net@@ worked , so that more people can get involved .
it mix@@ ed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe@@ ar to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thou@@ sand@@ -year ##AT##-##AT## old o@@ live trees .
this isn &apos;t about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
and this this ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise the virtual reality was something that people in pre ##AT##-##AT## @@ industrial times bit@@ ter@@ ly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a vi@@ o@@ lin string .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me $ 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor@@ e the entire week .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
play incre@@ ases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
he says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to conc@@ ern themselves with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic prototyp@@ es of communication , interaction , etc .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall@@ up survey .
that &apos;s rather sad for the ha@@ cker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ cian had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a complete stran@@ ger to my parents .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ ological constru@@ ct to protect you from the results of your work .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
this is not like human insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chemi@@ cally indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
the same technology that has produced the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce imm@@ unity against other viruses .
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the par@@ king lot was .
in the other , i was en@@ mes@@ hed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally sc@@ ar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and isol@@ ation .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intui@@ tive as possible , but also with complete transpar@@ ency .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar there , his name is wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes people say , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ ims , there is no free will .
some re@@ f@@ use to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and cru@@ m@@ ble in a fit of dra@@ matic passion .
so if we look at the development of our society , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed brie@@ fly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
unlike the sett@@ led midd@@ le ##AT##-##AT## @@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs , whose existence i was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all@@ -@@ expen@@ s@@ es@@ -@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experiment@@ al trial going on with v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain di@@ visi@@ ons .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cra@@ ck in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and i wonder@@ ed , maybe i could feel better again .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soc@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
in a world where over two days of video get u@@ plo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and un@@ expected can stand out in the way that these things have .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educ@@ ating themselves really well on it .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
i came to realize , as a physi@@ cian , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory , just different .
think about it , that a ma@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile com@@ m than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a ##AT##-##AT## @@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d ##AT##-##AT## @@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and tre@@ ating them .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of is@@ lands and so the people had to somehow navi@@ gate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
a terror@@ ist place , but it was was called wus@@ el@@ tr@@ oni@@ k and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mi@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ ei@@ gh@@ ties .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compared to when someone expres@@ ses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal be@@ have quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to ki@@ ck out all the other pas@@ sen@@ gers .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the con@@ ception , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that con@@ ception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the obje@@ ctive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subje@@ ctive socie@@ tal opini@@ on of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
so i went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your being came from you .
we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agen@@ cy we talked to ad@@ vis@@ ed their cli@@ ents not to take part .
i spend most of my time in very low ##AT##-##AT## @@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me court be the court of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ cial system there .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in it@@ al@@ y throw out a can of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a from their car window .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that ma@@ tter@@ ed was the common@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radical thing to do .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embra@@ ce a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ ager spac@@ ec@@ raft back towards the earth , in 199@@ 0 after it just passed saturn ?
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 ted talk .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , that is a lie .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ ver@@ sity as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to ada@@ pt to an increasingly challen@@ ging world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had helped you .
and many discus@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thir@@ ty years re@@ gar@@ ding photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about for@@ ty to six@@ ty bar .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of as@@ hes and was placed in my hands .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ as@@ h@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
for every nine people who have been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and rele@@ ased from death row .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use inter@@ active media and can come to the most satis@@ fying result possible .
when i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lux@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
so an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
i was se@@ vent@@ e@@ en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of ch@@ op@@ in &apos;s four bal@@ la@@ ds , one of his later works .
and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e pus@@ hed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
and sometimes , a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and i asked the man@@ ager , &quot; is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
the leader of the con@@ gress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
we want to encoura@@ ge a world of cre@@ ators , of inv@@ ent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
and that was then it &apos;s not bin@@ ding , but it &apos;s yes , i think it has managed to become accep@@ ted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ tory , doing &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , carb@@ -@@ fest and all@@ -@@ night s@@ essi@@ ons , tony dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the pres@@ entation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ cans , who then led to the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
now there &apos;s play@@ ful br@@ ands and min@@ d@@ ful br@@ ands , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the con@@ gress in fa@@ vor of this const@@ it@@ u@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to act as if the first theor@@ em were fal@@ se from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any pro@@ of .
it always makes for a happy conc@@ ert when i have the fortun@@ e to experience the piece an@@ e@@ w , even though i &apos;ve been working on it for so long in ad@@ v@@ ance .
but these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machin@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , addi@@ tional construction of co@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not possible .
according to bur@@ r@@ elles , the movie pre@@ mi@@ ered in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media impres@@ sions for this film .
but here &apos;s the thing that kee@@ ps me up at night -- one of the things that kee@@ ps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing life .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ ver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
what about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to mor@@ ally justi@@ fy something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the waste quite dra@@ matically as you &apos;re going through this process .
well in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police in apri@@ l 2011 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ pers .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging a different , color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit for every single occasi@@ on .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything that can be inclu@@ ded in that , like syn@@ thetic biology , etc .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ration@@ ally .
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
and our european energy grid basically consi@@ sts of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the ax@@ le always revol@@ ves around the whole of europe .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically .
so those are just a few of the cli@@ ps i colle@@ cted over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the trans@@ lation of liter@@ ature or even poetry .
i can make b@@ ach &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a b@@ aro@@ que har@@ p@@ sich@@ ord was not able to .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
and i made myself a bar@@ gain that if only i re@@ double my eff@@ or@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a vi@@ o@@ lin lesson with me .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high ##AT##-##AT## @@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ yp@@ ical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was ex@@ ecu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately je@@ wish ?
are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , sec@@ ure , sac@@ red , con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive or wise like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
and i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
at the media cam@@ pus , for example , we are attemp@@ ting to ren@@ der virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the u@@ tter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
so an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institution of government .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
at this point and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
you st@@ are out at a hori@@ zon that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this thi@@ ck , rich mar@@ s@@ hl@@ and .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is bat@@ tles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it che@@ cks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
and it &apos;s that play@@ ful curi@@ osity that dri@@ ves us to explore , dri@@ ves us to interact , and then the un@@ expected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ fes@@ pan has more than dou@@ bled , average per capit@@ a income ad@@ ju@@ sted for inf@@ lation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy the@@ ori@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house .
unlike the one ##AT##-##AT## @@ way entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , this community participa@@ tion is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or by doing something new with it .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
so i got a ti@@ cket for not ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of lo@@ gic to string together these complex ideas .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this sat@@ u@@ ration of c@@ g movies and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year ##AT##-##AT## old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
b@@ g : well , we need -- for one of these high ##AT##-##AT## @@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff@@ air with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the exten@@ sion of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
i had a lot of journ@@ alists calling me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
intui@@ tive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an element@@ ary economic factor , an element@@ ary success factor , when apple appe@@ ared on the scene , if i wanted to make technologi@@ cal devices us@@ able for people .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must trans@@ late these im@@ pre@@ cise indi@@ cations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non ##AT##-##AT## @@ verb@@ al musical language .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , where we could pre@@ cis@@ ely re@@ constru@@ ct , so to speak , the electrical ra@@ ti@@ o of the island on a one to three scale .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c roman@@ ce , passionate film . &quot;
so , the other grade is : are we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ emis@@ sion technology , have we de@@ plo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
up ti@@ ll now the following is always argu@@ ed in discus@@ sions , these is@@ lan@@ ders are becoming self ##AT##-##AT## @@ suff@@ i@@ cient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our jo@@ int network .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classi@@ cal software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the sou@@ l exists or not .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
and they will they have been increasingly over@@ written during the course of the cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
so of course , random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
and if you want to ex@@ ce@@ ed tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , you have to switch off dies@@ el .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridi@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative approach@@ es .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ kle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home .
one should eat the food that is lo@@ v@@ ingly coo@@ ked by a co@@ ok , not just look at it or pass on the reci@@ pe for it .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the s@@ hal@@ low oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
but we found ourselves la@@ g@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually fo@@ unded the company to do .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical pal@@ ette will have many more nu@@ an@@ ces of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
they look at biological materials in an arti@@ stic way and , yes , also electr@@ onic tin@@ ker@@ ing , and com@@ bine this in a very out@@ land@@ ish way .
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and cla@@ ims and is th@@ us of un@@ sound mind .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , conver@@ t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that makes that very production possible .
it &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doctor approach@@ es -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
my first memor@@ ies are from the boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the bo@@ w di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented all the various tas@@ ks that these ce@@ os enga@@ ged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
it got expres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
and by the way , we im@@ migra@@ te and circu@@ late and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al ##AT##-##AT## @@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cu@@ e if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
so you &apos;re notic@@ ing a change is taking place , from a defen@@ sive at@@ titude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es is right .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk . &quot;
and because they work so much harder physi@@ cally than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amo@@ unts to that of thir@@ ty billion people .
when this device sequences an r@@ na or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the c@@ d@@ c and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mic from happening in the first place .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it : fish far@@ ms po@@ ll@@ ute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
but for over two weeks , we progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the ven@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ s@@ est to doing what i wanted . &quot;
in sending her home , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the notion of happiness .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteri@@ stics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
and as far as isol@@ ation goes , when we as a species do col@@ oni@@ ze dist@@ ant planets , there will be the isol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vot@@ ing rights act .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
we only have phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years and phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing worldwide is already em@@ it@@ ting a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use tw@@ ent@@ y percent dies@@ el fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
and in that bon@@ d , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote reach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ v@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people dep@@ end .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surge@@ on who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .

i have ste@@ pped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
at that time , there were self ##AT##-##AT## @@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in kreu@@ z@@ berg in mehr@@ ing@@ h@@ of , where people thought evil took place .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing with qu@@ al@@ com@@ m foundation something called the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .

and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and trou@@ bled children caught between two worl@@ ds .

i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ ba class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le .
it could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizar@@ re collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ ternal thing that was not quite tom .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it ada@@ pt to us as well as we ada@@ pt to it .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
and of course the stories that i cho@@ se to tell were science fi@@ ction stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
and i went through the same period of sh@@ ame and rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to com@@ mit ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emplo@@ yer or who@@ ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ dness of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ o@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architec@@ ts , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
people believed that creativity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
and then i went to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ ei@@ gh@@ ties because i wanted to study rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and they didn &apos;t have that in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing ci@@ vi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .

the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just quant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed into a tiny space .
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .

and most pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to in@@ her@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wi@@ sely ?
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e ##AT##-##AT## @@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .

the fellow pas@@ sen@@ gers for in@@ anima@@ te objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these ad@@ vent@@ ures wearing nothing new .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
it dem@@ ands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .

we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that since we because of these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual man@@ ner , although we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epidemic of autis@@ m to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine shot .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world .
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high ##AT##-##AT## @@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ ft@@ ables , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand part@@ ners that they have .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many direc@@ tions .
now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
now , having sel@@ ec@@ ted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respond to that are time magazine people of the year .
given who we were and how life had sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fund@@ ing for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this si@@ x ##AT##-##AT## @@ pack of be@@ er -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the wo@@ ods .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an adverti@@ sing effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
i have a company that does design and anima@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is definitely an intri@@ cate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t po@@ ll@@ ute . &quot;
it means that when we can see that we can trans@@ fer exi@@ sting performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vi@@ ral particles .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ d@@ ingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this ro@@ se ##AT##-##AT## @@ tin@@ ted area .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quanti@@ ties .

one , we bat@@ ter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the in@@ sur@@ ance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , called ab@@ b today , in the se@@ venti@@ es , and was then licen@@ sed to the japanese .
so , i suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
what is particularly impres@@ sive in the area of inter@@ active media is the fact that we &apos;ve an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed the ability to think in a non ##AT##-##AT## @@ lin@@ ear way in our biological memory .
and part of me also wonder@@ s , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ mr@@ i ?
two years later i was an atten@@ ding in the emergen@@ cy department at a community hospital just north of tor@@ onto , and i saw a 25 year ##AT##-##AT## old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at .
according to the auth@@ or of the book the story@@ telling animal , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ tsch@@ all , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the re@@ ception of stories .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and we ro@@ unded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pet for as far as you could see .
and we &apos;re just trying to demon@@ strate that we can de@@ cre@@ ase the capac@@ i@@ ties , the mu@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ run capac@@ i@@ ties , by putting electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the network too .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , for@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighborhood in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quie@@ t , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
and the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preser@@ ve a lot of genes that would otherwise be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ moved from the population .
and at the end of the day , i pac@@ ked up to leave the hospital and walked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citi@@ zen .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vi@@ bra@@ te and not vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
we have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s : bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gent optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with muse@@ ums and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
only things that are subject to wear and te@@ ar , such as sho@@ e sol@@ es , bra@@ ke co@@ ver@@ ings , car ty@@ r@@ es , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
we can go to watch our kid play soc@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , on our la@@ ps .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is f@@ ed with pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded video .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
so for those people who did choose to participa@@ te , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .

a collea@@ gue of mine got access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have de@@ vot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
another example is so ##AT##-##AT## @@ called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my pres@@ entation , we are physi@@ cally moving in non ##AT##-##AT## @@ exist@@ ent , virtual worl@@ ds there , according to the example of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; ap@@ es since they have frequ@@ ent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ ex@@ ual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ a@@ king idea how i was going to c@@ ash .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and lo@@ gic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
by not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
and the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .

so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and when this breath of air po@@ urs out onto a human , the human is filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with mind , with nature that can only live with a sou@@ l .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self ##AT##-##AT## @@ organi@@ zing power of networks , to the physical one .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .

the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ and@@ ing and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws .

the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in .

once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .

here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spee@@ ding up evolution with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called digital do@@ main .
and if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the ima@@ gery ?
if they become more intui@@ tive and then i have to rough@@ -@@ hand@@ le my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
so as you all rec@@ all , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the top@@ ic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the top@@ ic of the relationship between man and object of course .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .

now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanis@@ ms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the boo@@ ster rock@@ ets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
i approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making portra@@ its of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
now we can do it in a more pre@@ cise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vi@@ tam@@ in a into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .

imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ hol on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
can i give them a bo@@ w in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the vast hori@@ zon that guar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?

well , when there are lots of alterna@@ tives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of alterna@@ tives that you re@@ je@@ ct , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .

so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chromo@@ some .
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illu@@ strate this .

if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also .

when you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .

i have in my po@@ cket a check made out to the par@@ ent organization to the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be applied toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s ted .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legi@@ ti@@ mate scientific sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ ons about the notion of , basically fa@@ i@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .

b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .

okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently invest@@ ing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magni@@ tude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .

and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pp@@ er part , used multiple zer@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ day vulner@@ abilities .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cular recogni@@ tion technology , but i just recogni@@ zed something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
so that &apos;s currently the the core obje@@ ctive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ bility , so that that more people can get involved .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating spa@@ tial relationships .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce note .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomen@@ al phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than when i am able to make these things acc@@ essi@@ ble via hier@@ arch@@ ically organis@@ ed web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms so to speak .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transpor@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpo@@ ra@@ tions and governments could only do in the past .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely dist@@ ant ones , for professional staf@@ f , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with a doctor &apos;s degree et@@ c. only .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americ@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ fe@@ cated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m@@ s. par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an ee@@ g or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also ha@@ ck into it , that &apos;s it , and i thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del@@ ve into that .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st ##AT##-##AT## @@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans i had ever had .
so i pres@@ ented another fac@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ filled lec@@ ture that inclu@@ ded a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non ##AT##-##AT## @@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wir@@ eless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co ##AT##-##AT## @@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by steve sei@@ tz at u.@@ w .

okay ? there we are slo@@ g@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ saving mission , right away .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vi@@ tt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t ##AT##-##AT## @@ to ##AT##-##AT## @@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fra@@ c@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the mas@@ ses ?
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
this is a condition in which the heart fa@@ ils , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the l@@ ung@@ s fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a not@@ e@@ book that is used by a ma@@ inten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , then we are in business .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
imagine you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
and when i listen@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure .
and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ astern ecu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d ##AT##-##AT## @@ style evolution into ne@@ o ##AT##-##AT## @@ evolution .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wra@@ pped in the ad@@ ver@@ sity .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pas@@ s@@ words .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being is .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kil@@ o@@ watt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l ##AT##-##AT## @@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing was bad .
we &apos;re challen@@ ging teams around the world to basically com@@ bine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a@@ .@@ i@@ . , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed prac@@ tically everything that could be developed electr@@ on@@ ically and in terms of software between the individual systems .
there is ad@@ ver@@ sity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ ver@@ sity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so eng@@ aging , and immer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it fun@@ ctions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intui@@ tive or naturally mana@@ ge@@ able as possible .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at em@@ c , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ bay .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot;
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ and ##AT##-##AT## @@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at oni@@ ons and made them light up and stuff like that .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of c@@ ameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone c@@ ameras to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , stit@@ ched together in this environment .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in the con@@ gress to am@@ end their const@@ it@@ ution to have a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determin@@ ed by the larger ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack that immediately attra@@ cts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electr@@ on@@ ics sector where you also find a whole tin@@ ker@@ er scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circu@@ its .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a view port .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ us@@ hed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cr@@ us@@ hed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity and our in@@ na@@ te ability to imagine .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in my an@@ atom@@ y class the orig@@ ins and exer@@ tions of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
as the note is anything but a pre@@ cise indi@@ cation of the desire of a com@@ pos@@ er , and is , rather , a frame@@ work , i will now u@@ tili@@ se this frame@@ work to fill it with sense and meaning .
we there put out six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sam@@ ple some ja@@ m ?
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ d@@ ologi@@ cally .
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capac@@ i@@ ties -- that better memory .
and what you can do with it and approach@@ ing society very tar@@ ge@@ ted@@ ly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occu@@ pi@@ ed for three seconds .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two ##AT##-##AT## @@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one ##AT##-##AT## @@ week vac@@ ation .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h ##AT##-##AT## @@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be remin@@ ded of how horri@@ ble the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ f@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which origin@@ ally comes from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , and it &apos;s a network based in europe with a co@@ operation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing .
simply by virtu@@ e of the fact that mary was born pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .

in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ s , believed that to u@@ tter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into existence .

they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .

years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and satis@@ fied , in a narra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ astern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of to@@ ma@@ to@@ es .
so those are the three main attac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anony@@ mous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks .
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
the other hat that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worl@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm exten@@ si@@ vely instead of just intensi@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produ@@ cers , but experts in relationships .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
but that &apos;s the ni@@ c@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because bacteria communicate .

something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water cre@@ ature , we actually embra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of metal is free to act however it wanted .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spi@@ ritual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well ##AT##-##AT## @@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mes@@ sages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distin@@ ct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
not burning the bio@@ soli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cy@@ cles in the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation plant , but asking on@@ es@@ el@@ f , how do you close cy@@ cles ?
that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
and i came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ vable scale and un@@ belie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villa@@ ges and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society .
most fe@@ males like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chromo@@ so@@ mal ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ males like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mr@@ i &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commer@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .
i don &apos;t need to get emotion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , color@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0 ##AT##-##AT## @@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen@@ cing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
immediately after that vote , on febru@@ ary 21@@ st to the 24@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high ##AT##-##AT## @@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very b@@ ad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor re@@ f@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ ologist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on angi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my avo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ fi@@ ghter , i am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness on a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al scale , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the ad@@ vice that designers must also think differently to arri@@ ve at new solutions , and so i thank you war@@ m@@ ly for your attention and please .
i always keep my thes@@ au@@ rus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the de@@ vil , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &quot;
and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fe@@ ar ##AT##-##AT## @@ based reaction .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ ologi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
well , they took , over a three ##AT##-##AT## @@ month period , d ##AT##-##AT## @@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three ##AT##-##AT## @@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a ##AT##-##AT## @@ level .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dra@@ matic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intelle@@ ct and reason .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is brand@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve ##AT##-##AT## @@ the ##AT##-##AT## @@ ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .

and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became the co ##AT##-##AT## @@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in ##AT##-##AT## @@ off q@@ -@@ cells .
that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course .
i became en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in sing@@ le ##AT##-##AT## @@ cell@@ ed organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natu@@ re ##AT##-##AT## @@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mit@@ s our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .

my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jum@@ ps on this cur@@ ve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ than@@ e by micro@@ bes .
now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ cise sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
i started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ anz and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de , and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cloud .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start fall@@ ing apart ?
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
henry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .

and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low ##AT##-##AT## @@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
we look into this network , see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ tz , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again .

instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neu@@ ral model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .

so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .

the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .

now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .

what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .

i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to ad@@ mit , that there are some golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .

and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .

now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ mir kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.@@ s .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that stun@@ ning display .

so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .

and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscop@@ e .

another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ var@@ ies and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .

those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .

if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
because we want this self ##AT##-##AT## @@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being brilliant , des@@ cen@@ ded from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un@@ predic@@ table as an organis@@ m that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
but the process , and the heavy an@@ x@@ iety around it was rele@@ ased when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trouble , and rele@@ ased it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sation , international best@@ s@@ eller thing .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
but we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adverti@@ ser would normally never get behind .
and our a@@ im was , we wanted to reach se@@ vent@@ y to nin@@ et@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ ent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from bat@@ ter@@ ies won &apos;t work either .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ tig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been de@@ plo@@ yed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s colle@@ cted anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
but we don &apos;t even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted colle@@ c@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
i wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfort of life in an uns@@ ung sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters en@@ ding each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ lin pas@@ sage work in the last movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its simpli@@ city , or alterna@@ tively , we inv@@ o@@ ke th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can rele@@ ase the power of so many more children , and invi@@ te them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then tra@@ pped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .
i then tried to exp@@ and this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test , so dna finger@@ prin@@ ting in other words , at home again .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qua@@ int and color@@ ful but somehow re@@ duced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i divi@@ de them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus i show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and divi@@ de them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choo@@ sing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web@@ c@@ am , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led it , took off the l@@ ens , turned it around and then we have a microscop@@ e , which has a four hundred fold magni@@ fication appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely .
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce .
fir@@ stly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of ex@@ cre@@ tions you have , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your po@@ tty and sti@@ r its cont@@ ents , your curi@@ osity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organis@@ ed two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shor@@ tly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to in@@ form the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organis@@ ed these these little actions at street festi@@ v@@ als and tried to explain dna to people .
i was reading this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the as@@ sau@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ hed .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ sur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ c@@ ement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ str@@ ust .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virg@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact with vast amo@@ unts of visual data .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and then you end up in one of these ph@@ ases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutsch@@ mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uni@@ form pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
and the conversation i had with de@@ an kamen this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these thi@@ ck , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than anything -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ it@@ ation .
cloud computing , what my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call infin@@ ite computing ; sensor@@ s and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3d prin@@ ting , which is the ability to democra@@ ti@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; syn@@ thetic biology ; fu@@ els , vac@@ cin@@ es and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ o@@ materials ; and a@@ .@@ i .
and so with this pre@@ mis@@ es with this pre@@ mis@@ es , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini@@ -@@ laboratory , took a pressure coo@@ ker , a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and b@@ red bacteria with it , working like this .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ sting species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
if you should ever have the chance to staf@@ f your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be cho@@ sen .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bi@@ og@@ as , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a farmer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad e@@ col@@ o@@ gical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technologi@@ cal innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the vi@@ o@@ lin if i started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ lin pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ and ##AT##-##AT## @@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , e@@ ternal myster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why nin@@ et@@ y ##AT##-##AT## @@ nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intui@@ tive or not inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously us@@ able , including the i@@ pad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly as@@ s@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the dies@@ el is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decisi@@ on ##AT##-##AT## @@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern spa@@ in , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; o@@ le , o@@ le , o@@ le , &quot; which you still hear in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces .
that here is bio@@ curious , the ha@@ cker@@ space i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent@@ re for for molecular biology .
i encoura@@ ge all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bon@@ d that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bon@@ d , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
and if i now trans@@ fer this , if i let ori@@ ent take shape as an over@@ view , sele@@ ct as a sele@@ ction , in@@ form in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , trans@@ act means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the sh@@ opp@@ ing , etc . ,
the human ability to ada@@ pt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phr@@ ase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ de ##AT##-##AT## @@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russi@@ a , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy agenda .
no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ arc@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the in@@ her@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the pro@@ spe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est five ##AT##-##AT## @@ year ##AT##-##AT## old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ecu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ hab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
impli@@ c@@ it in this phr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circum@@ navi@@ gate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non ##AT##-##AT## @@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce ##AT##-##AT## @@ in ##AT##-##AT## @@ a ##AT##-##AT## @@ lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ opp@@ ing from an infe@@ cted computer .
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cro@@ o@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to engage during their ha@@ ma@@ ts@@ a initi@@ ation .

and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from syn@@ thetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
just a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded its dra@@ per prize to fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques to encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- what fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old calls &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot;
and has nothing more to do with reality .

in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a ##AT##-##AT## @@ sets -- and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination re@@ duced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
i had this en@@ counter recently where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virg@@ ini@@ a , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the landscape .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
a couple of years ago , the las@@ ker prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ ast , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duced that cell to rever@@ t to a plu@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communic@@ ations device -- i give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .

and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;

now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ ies is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
