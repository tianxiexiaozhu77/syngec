wonderful right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
what a fish .
not very sustainable .
that &apos;s me , of me .
exciting .
very different term .
they &apos;re all important .
but essential .
so local .
and she did .
thank you .
this was the result .
just do your job .
good job !
yeah , good , good noon .
similar principles .
that &apos;s our present .
milli@@ seconds .
whole environmental discussion .
what do you say ?
we can do that .
i &apos;m all interested in me .
len@@ to , slow .
yeah , good , good noon .
that &apos;s what we is .
that is the system .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
what did they do ?
the farm is incredible .
be honest ?
that was fascinating .
extremely important .
a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
i know .
no normal .
oh , that &apos;s the one .
very good .
a few more .
he op@@ ens the door .
why not live longer ?
sensor@@ s .
here &apos;s the video .
see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
i was surprised .
ban blan@@ k .
but you know what ?
what happened ?
centers were built .
i don &apos;t know .
and that is important .
again .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , good .
what happened ?
these people make money .
days are over .
can we change ?
this is the last .
flying c@@ at .
yeah , it can .
media today ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
not management .
let &apos;s call him don .
and i was an artist .
a wish .
b@@ g : thanks .
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because what ?
how do we know ?
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
you can go .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
you care .
so how does this work ?
your hands .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think that .
what do these people need ?
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
so let &apos;s see .
bad . &quot;
so do that .
players don &apos;t sit around .
i was facing him .
okay . thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
so she was back .
and i kept working .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
what do you want to do ?
let me tell you .
oh . a moment .
so why does this even happening ?
thanks .
we need energy wonder .
there are two ways .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
or bom@@ bs .
but i kept working .
not tox@@ ic .
you see it immediately .
they even hurt .
why should we do that ?
thanks for listening .
he won &apos;t do that .
i wonder .
i swe@@ ar it .
great .
i represent children .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but the wrong things .
it &apos;s against justice .
no food .
tremendous challenge .
and i understand .
people crazy .
the data came in .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
maybe 10 times .
be a ment@@ or .
thank you .
so here you see it now .
but gets worse .
j@@ k : both .
imagine the camera .
yeah . all right .
i created one .
first , limited .
after one journey .
my gut feeling again .
what creates illusion ?
and that &apos;s what it was .
very expensive real mo@@ state .
and i always had that .
does anybody see something ?
give pe@@ e a chance .
this is no protection .
lucky , yes ?
china was different .
you do compar@@ ison .
i mean the sou@@ l .
what must be done ?
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
why is that ?
i &apos;ll agree with you .
yeah , here it is .
he had experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
i think think &apos;t .
some came and left .
oh , thank you .
will i like color ?
good after@@ noon , everybody together .
here &apos;s the city .
he liked .
she did that secre@@ tly tly did .
and it &apos;s getting better than that .
almost iden@@ tical structure .
is that what your opini@@ , too ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it kee@@ you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is am@@ it .
go on . fun .
the answer is no .
okay , a few more .
let me wra@@ p up .
it was re@@ mix@@ es .
and then it became international .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
is it even photograph@@ y ?
here &apos;s another example .
there &apos;s something else .
you saw these guys ?
it has billions of these .
i never forget .
i never forget .
we &apos;ve lost in touch .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it would be in@@ toler@@ able .
crisis . death . disaster .
many people forget .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
he always went here .
still fish .
we have three main groups .
online crimin@@ als .
priv@@ acy must be true .
what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
don &apos;t be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
... inv@@ ent his own story .
how do we humans work ?
they had mass media .
where are we useful ?
the work of interpre@@ ter .
this is model .
let &apos;s also call him don .
but what do your fish eat ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
first we have the population .
who will make it ?
what do you think what happened now ?
paul off@@ it .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
this game from 2007 .
i want to ask you something .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
who are these ?
so what happened years later ?
i had a good life .
you see the water coming .
that &apos;s short .
i grew up in india .
is it about the light ?
they look like this .
and i was va@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
the only country in the world .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily he didn &apos;t die .
i &apos;ll stop .
why not think about it ?
this is down there .
you also have to understand that .
most of you know .
we &apos;ve got to spread the news .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
sounds crazy , right ?
will it be my size ?
his name is temp@@ t .
what do i looking ?
it &apos;s something like this .
but what do we do ?
and this op@@ ens a map .
we &apos;re constantly breaking apart .
it would be knowledge .
we love creativity .
he went up and down .
actually , i made two mistakes .
fe@@ li@@ x .
they had no books .
so what do we have to do ?
conflict comes creativity .
or is it possible ?
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
you can &apos;t have any b@@ ones .
we &apos;re too many of that .
we were 20 people .
it sounds bad .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
i &apos;m going to finish finish now .
this is what the graph looked like .
what else can we do ?
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
.
they called me .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
what is the sou@@ l ?
i can say everything .
we &apos;re longer producing ourselves .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
so what has actually happened ?
and then they set them up .
so here &apos;s how it works .
but the cru@@ cial is , is ...
that &apos;s the exciting .
fit@@ ness ?
these changes are coming .
one is south korea .
and that &apos;s not nothing yet .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
the answer is yes .
they could have done better .
it &apos;s like that , you know .
what is this thing ?
this was christ@@ mas .
why cking cking now ?
so it &apos;s the circle .
does that make you curious ?
because you can train that .
and how did that feel ?
my wife told me .
that &apos;s a natural thing .
again , you have it again .
thank you for your attention .
i loved two .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i wanted to support them .
they want to feed the world ?
who is most successful ?
same thing , bigger .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and finally , epi@@ c meaning .
let &apos;s honest -- who is normal ?
well , i was next .
first exten@@ sion , second two .
they saw the big impact .
and then everybody went down .
i got a@@ we .
that was the beginning of the journey .
but it was very sad .
and that worked very well .
that is very ris@@ ky .
tell me about this world .
and it took 18 months .
i see this record .
this picture is from this place .
think about your own decisions .
okay , a couple .
her mother pulled her alone .
connected those two people .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
sometimes i push too much .
and here &apos;s the cru@@ x .
the answer is no . &quot;
so let me remember .
is that rational ?
that is god , you know ?
this is a game outside .
for example , this perception in the context .
does anybody know what this is ?
pattern recogni@@ tion should work .
it was &apos;t invented yet .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
they always say , why ?
there can &apos;t be at problem .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
and he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so they saw something ma@@ gical .
it was a huge success .
so that &apos;s the good news .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
everybody is talking about happiness today .
they changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
so , we can do too .
how many people choose creativity ?
is this just education ?
how did that happen ?
play is not sil@@ ly .
the data was not available before .
you can have this cloud .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the power plant can explo@@ de .
i shouldn not say that .
they come from the artists .
that showed him four .
they are all important possibilities . &quot;
well , we want .
what happened that day ?
the story is not over .
no , had never been one opportunity .
sometimes perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t go that fast .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
that made me really sad really sad .
it &apos;s not our br@@ den .
and there &apos;s good news .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are hundreds of them .
i was memor@@ memor@@ i@@ everything .
she was back and dying .
she share her experiences with others .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
he actually cted fish .
it was my first sun@@ fire .
people were still happy .
be kog@@ i . &quot;
everybody needs a gold glass .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
and we all that .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
if right now , that &apos;s waste .
an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
it doesn &apos;t have that sou@@ l .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation again .
and of course , these are incredibly talks .
taste very good .
i almost never cooking .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
what should our look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
take nothing for gran@@ ted .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terror@@ ist .
nobody said before .
the data is always ting that all the time .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
they create epi@@ history .
which one would you like the most ?
and this was 19 years ago .
play isn &apos;t just child games .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
in the morning , in front of the game .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
the whole building was water .
you can play with different types .
and then something funny happened .
what other brand act ?
this is one of the images .
basically , they do the same thing .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we went to one area .
it &apos;s it , it &apos;s simple .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a much .
today 2.@@ 3 million .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
that was great .
the white lines represent population .
but you know what ?
i started feeling better .
but there are two problems .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
so the question is : how ?
and we &apos;re too many of that .
waste waste nutri@@ ent .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
and they have a problem .
four and a half thousand people .
it just doesn &apos;t .
he showed the al@@ ga@@ e .
so i made the film .
what lessons did we learn ?
this has the biggest impact .
that &apos;s why other other things shouldn &apos;t er .
and then realize it .
because did anybody meas@@ k here ?
they become free computers .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
we all love baseball , right ?
it beat a 25@@ 7 .
my second mistake was worse .
once we started one alive .
okay , that &apos;s really coura@@ ge .
and then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and the shape plays a role .
that would have been no problem at all .
further beyond that , we don &apos;t go .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
slowly but sur@@ ely , it moved .
they &apos;re getting more similar .
i can say everything .
this is all the meta@@ data .
we use the energy of the sun .
i &apos;ll give you something .
and it starts with a physi@@ cian .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
the nur@@ se said .
today , everything &apos;s just to have today .
so creativity had to get out .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
next : nuclear energy .
i really wanted to normal normal then .
i got a little bit sc@@ ared of technology .
so i went to the court .
we can &apos;t just do that .
once the ju@@ dge saw me .
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
that sounds sc@@ ary .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
mm@@ mm , my brand ?
quie@@ t leave that .
it &apos;s completely tri@@ tri@@ ous .
zero mis@@ sions , yes ?
but we need that together .
but it &apos;s not effective , yes ?
the reason to write it .
i tried something exciting .
dark ur@@ ine . dark dark .
so what does a story look like ?
i remember my first fire .
just who you are .
what else ris@@ ky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
her family gather@@ together .
and his answer was yes . &quot;
you can &apos;t do something from nothing .
do you want je@@ ans with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
and that &apos;s at the beginning at the beginning .
anyway not to navi@@ gate .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
so you can &apos;t even do that at all .
we say sustain@@ ability in germany .
how and how did it feel ?
because to me it means memory memory .
it &apos;s like learning .
have you ever been an@@ di@@ c ?
i put something through your head .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
and then we said , &quot; okay .
so i just started playing .
and that changed the dynam@@ ics really changed .
so , see what happens .
so the cor@@ relation is small .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
the game begins -- sil@@ .
and this video is in real time .
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
this is a child game , right ?
that didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
i went to prison -- hard .
i like things that are different .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
all adults were aware of the risks .
it spread rapi@@ dly .
it can know where we are .
why did i go to medicine ?
it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
and there are several reasons for this .
we started this 15 years ago .
sun@@ light and co2 are a method .
i find it comfortable .
this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
in the book and in the picture .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
we can get our nutri@@ ents back .
that &apos;s the minim@@ um .
you can show i was there .
if you get to that , yes ?
that &apos;s got to be the age difference .
and it &apos;s always no interpretation .
so the first step to an interpretation .
do you know what nei@@ vy is ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
how far do you even get there ?
music is medicine . music changes us .
assu@@ mption of of maybe two percent .
they were f@@ ding the chan@@ n@@ els .
and that i i stop . thank you very much .
i could draw . i could paint .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
anyway , we need a solution .
there &apos;s another reason .
and that can make a big difference .
nothing to do with science .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
five million people use it every month .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
these will be resi@@ stent .
and you know what i learned ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
do we really want to go this way ?
you can do this all the time .
but the truth is far away .
he can only use his eyes .
i really like beautiful clo@@ thing .
you see something fun here .
it was quite popular .
this is a picture of the object .
so we measu@@ red its movement .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
something went into me .
oh my time is over ?
they didn &apos;t ab@@ and@@ up the government .
and these are neu@@ ral structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
but that &apos;s not the case .
because we live on a water planet .
baseball is full of great statistics .
i don &apos;t take the same trend .
i &apos;m the new@@ ly defined doctor .
they had been gene@@ tically .
priv@@ acy is not debate .
le@@ go made it possible for everyone .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
a has these benefits and risks .
these ri@@ vers are increasing rapi@@ dly .
this &apos;s memory ets .
here &apos;s it &apos;s tting the sun go up .
it was a pretty pretty fortun@@ y project .
i &apos;d like to prove that .
and what does that mean for designers ?
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a with children .
he was over six .
and this sounds very different than before .
no , no , not .
i loved with this fish .
do it for kids ? &quot;
a billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
now i see gre@@ g le@@ moon .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
architec@@ ts and engineers , fortunately .
i push my sle@@ ev@@ back .
and the goal is very simple .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so this crazy story could agree .
who does &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
we won some pri@@ wards .
and i had to go out of the city .
okay , you really want to know that ?
that was more about em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zation .
they want to ori@@ ent themselves in the museum ?
but you really want deep .
it has to experience the experience .
here &apos;s her br@@ ing gang .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
we need to increase increase complexity .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cents .
her father died soon after she was born .
the de@@ fe@@ would would have been too easy .
who would ever wish one ?
but it requires a lot of planning .
and every morning i jump that .
we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
how do i get to re@@ move you ? &quot;
now now we do that with air@@ planes .
i learned this from my grandmother .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i started with my usual talk .
it &apos;s about changing standards .
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
the st@@ ones are color co@@ ded .
longer than those other two networks .
often often forget forget in the third .
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
how do we think from north .
we can rein@@ vent vent .
i started an institute .
that &apos;s how natural things are introduced .
auto@@ matically , it goes to the right thought .
they are project tors today .
it eng@@ ves with san@@ ity .
simply , that &apos;s how it will come .
6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
and that brought me so so together ...
that &apos;s ide@@ ology , not science .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad thing .
playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
i call this the bright tiger .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
we need to think about what br@@ ands .
the film hasn not been deli@@ ted yet .
they &apos;re even bringing in fund@@ ing .
this is o@@ live oil .
who do you want to form ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who could all have anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ this ?
i talked a lot about magic .
these are ap@@ sar@@ as .
my brother star@@ at me .
this this may be broad@@ public public public .
we &apos;ve run a lot of process .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think , everywhere , there are op@@ tions .
we actually re@@ defined poverty .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a easy game .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
b@@ j@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud .
and everybody in this room goes .
the result of it was dis@@ ast@@ ous .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
we &apos;ve achie@@ ed a kind of equ@@ balance .
thanks , but best best comes .
they gave their blood pressure .
the living give birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
i don &apos;t know who knows .
the people about the ur@@ ine .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
there are also world recor@@ ds as well .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
which words would you describe ban ?
they did very well .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the other one had strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
and nobody seems to rain about that .
all of these generations need a few milli@@ seconds .
i tried to understand them .
for energy , i loved this .
and that &apos;s where you feel it already .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
the students are divi@@ ded by gra@@ des .
say what you feel .
they were inter@@ per@@ dri@@ each other .
here is how the building works .
the question is , what &apos;s happening now ?
he &apos;s interested in care for ligh@@ ting .
there he applied .
so here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
let &apos;s make a little inter@@ ate ima@@ print .
completely focused on a particular ination .
he died , broken by history .
it &apos;s going to deeply touch you .
you lose losing and rare animals .
we put unique elements here .
that &apos;s basically sound unusual un@@ unusual at first time .
the product is clean water .
so you have two cir@@ cles .
especially if he already died .
i hope you for@@ give me .
&quot; best in the industry . &quot;
they literally put the le@@ ver .
it &apos;s been const@@ ant increasing .
so this is a hard nose .
they have them . they always have .
what do you think happens next ?
love are simply in our lives .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
let &apos;s start with seeing .
it turns off the engine .
... ... so , it &apos;s not that optimi@@ stic .
they brought your pictures , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
poli@@ dly everybody all appl@@ au@@ d .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
he pulled back to sil@@ ence .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked late late at night .
so scot@@ t gets this leader .
maybe have some mu@@ tations .
they took us from being inspired .
i represent people in death cells .
i wrote these crazy things .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
we go through initi@@ a@@ tional ritu@@ als .
you &apos;re someone &apos;s &apos;s countries .
these are mobile phones in the future .
they are all occu@@ p@@ ing questions .
it &apos;s about new care of america .
we have to get far , quickly .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
so modern modern into computer society .
you &apos;re going to look from from back to back .
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , right .
it &apos;s also such a paradig@@ m shift .
and curi@@ osity is not learn .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
we can support them to be good .
we can support them to be good .
but with the right design , there we go .
the mechan@@ ism comes from lying .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
we also got very specific data .
this will take place next next apri@@ l .
he was sha@@ king his head , no .
it was really profound .
we talk talking t@@ ly about it .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
i &apos;ll you the post .
sexual re@@ production enter the picture .
the main man was wa@@ king me to me .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and women argu@@ ed this success@@ fully .
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
the roof was also covered water .
this is a painting of circle .
that &apos;s usually to be the rou@@ te .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
no , that &apos;s what i was thinking .
and she &apos;s also very ris@@ ky as well .
we talk about chicken , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel .
even cat@@ s watch this video .
i never met him personally .
i believed everybody could .
it might take long it to be invited .
and something very strange is going on here .
you should wish wish one .
what will these three billion people bring ?
we expect some extraordinary decades .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
but i kept asking these questions .
that is the system that we &apos;re living in .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
she hadn &apos;t come .
but today we are way beyond beyond .
they ta@@ p into their internet connection .
15@@ 6 nations send our chan@@ nel .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
no , no , far missing .
maybe also have a look behind it .
just alone , what is information ?
i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
what takes five and two milli@@ seconds ?
what just just shown .
that &apos;s such a tra@@ ried part .
you put things like box .
the che@@ f had coo@@ ked it .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t in rela@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s successful , &quot; he said .
this is environmental network .
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
and also , these sources under@@ lying dis@@ rup@@ tions .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks .
there was never a time like this .
they &apos;re gone . they are gone .
does anyone know what that is ?
not even the truth is going to free you .
we have meas@@ ks in this country now .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
and why ? gene@@ tically changed food .
there &apos;s also the do@@ sage ing makes a role .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
and there are enough employees .
so the first exciting pri@@ mate .
we can afford ourselves ourselves .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people .
the di@@ states of these species don &apos;t exist with us .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with myself . &quot;
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and that was the break of life .
temp@@ t is completely paraly@@ zed .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tell me about that part .
they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
there &apos;s another thing about history .
and i &apos;d like to read them those to you .
somebody made an ol@@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let rid of you . &quot;
the water@@ fer comes from a different place .
this is a hum@@ little ap@@ p .
boston doesn &apos;t just a call center .
so there creates a feedback feedback .
it can know how we hold it .
i learned some very simple things .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
maybe i did with good reason .
you &apos;re grown , you measu@@ about five centi@@ meters .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is open source .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al di@@ p of the water .
but we start to see change .
he just got to process that as the present .
i &apos;ll try this through an example .
its personal impres@@ sions of the se@@ ero@@ sis .
a particularly beautiful story , as i think .
and then he can walk away .
because now you can apply a tri@@ sentence .
and here you can see the thing again .
bad ? i was completely conf@@ used .
and what do you do with the waste ?
there are a few things that &apos;s got to come together .
you process , you understand it .
the guy in the middle not that much .
we don &apos;t want companies to own see@@ ds .
because we don &apos;t want to sho@@ ot the genes around ?
what does this look like ? pretty good .
we get that this an absolutely flat line .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
in many cases these people are completely healthy .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine .
the goal of the whole film is transpar@@ ency .
a whole bow@@ h of cool whi@@ p eat .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artist .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
now who &apos;s ready for this journey ?
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry plants .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
my cou@@ s@@ ins were running everywhere .
many of my cli@@ ents are very young .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ ed .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
alone , dama@@ ged and without support .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it was a grou@@ per .
language is expression of the human mind .
let &apos;s now out something different .
yes . it does nothing else than discover .
but i &apos;ll come to talk that in a minute .
sha@@ ke the environment , make less waste .
it should con@@ tain the two elements again .
this &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
well , i &apos;m going to show it to you .
he had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
but the game is a for@@ mal trans@@ duc@@ er .
i mean , what will i find today ?
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
this &apos;s ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
as an artist , context relationship matters very important .
ordinary people are not available to available . &quot;
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
now the next step happened within these communities .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
i &apos;m getting ti@@ red like all of us .
sleep de@@ vation is u@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
but western governments help themselves .
this is my super@@ market . no big .
other areas -- the world of communication .
it just happened , you know ?
this is one , part of her .
and e@@ col@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
that really causes the fuel problem .
so it &apos;s here . right .
thank you . that was incredible .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
by the way , this is just the labor ti@@ ute .
he had plo@@ aded a lot of natural videos .
and the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
and further , now you &apos;re always it it .
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
so , &apos;s basically a trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
so what can we conclu@@ de from all of this ?
does &apos;t need half or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great , that this number is ris@@ up .
what are the actions do i call for ?
you can predict that . why is this ?
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
this country unlike 40 years ago .
so far , this was a problem for super@@ computers .
there are lots of great books on this top@@ ic .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can actually com@@ pt .
the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f dre@@ w all the str@@ ands .
in two hours she buil@@ ds everywhere .
now the instru@@ ments have evolved .
or take a li@@ p@@ pen .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
man 3 : i &apos;m the dow guy .
i want to explain explain just a little bit .
you know three three sentence from school .
in that tri@@ sentence come three sent@@ ences .
bear didn &apos;t want to make vi@@ ral video .
they &apos;re going to make us worse to standing there .
the quanti@@ unts have increas@@ ed .
i &apos;m happy to be there .
imagine mo@@ z@@ ingly efficient .
so help me me a little bit .
do you remember the win@@ l again ?
and then it usually looks like this .
it &apos;s kind of ti@@ ed us up .
you burn coal : no .
mon@@ day : color is something powerful .
my mother called me a few minutes .
we were asking around , and no one knew it .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
re@@ fresh america . find out more .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and you can continue the list list end@@ less .
now , what are actually arch@@ a@@ ical models ?
so it &apos;s likely to say the nor@@ m .
now , everybody &apos;s eating ca@@ ke .
and there &apos;s a central point about it .
no , we hold what &apos;s inside .
can you play them in blue too ?
say , there are no predic@@ tions .
he said &quot; sustainable proteins .
so that really ble@@ w my off .
if you burn natural gas : no .
they know that science is not a company .
and let me start with an example .
people suff@@ ered . people fighting .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not a much better .
maybe we can see vulner@@ ability as change .
raise your hands . let me see .
imagine that for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
second hal@@ f-@@ time . end of the normal play time .
that means something that is built in the city .
imagine an airplane full of smo@@ ke .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
you go around and am@@ use yourself .
you can very easily in and zo@@ om om out .
that &apos;s what . thank you .
we &apos;re think of energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
let me show you how they work .
they just listen and start start talking .
offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
their problem is they have too little .
they laugh@@ ed more than you do here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
this is the machine underneath gen@@ ev@@ a .
if not not , somebody else tor@@ ks today .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
now i add a ass .
now , think a a bit further .
and the two lat@@ ders are here today .
now you &apos;re looking at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
this is something called the o@@ o@@ ts model .
sha@@ the the environment , use less energy .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s with it , isn &apos;t it ?
you can come into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
we talk about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning into information . &quot;
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
and there &apos;s the stor@@ ting problem .
my parents are 80 in the far .
we forced them . pu@@ ff .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we re@@ je@@ ct gene@@ ologi@@ cally changed food .
what ? that really fre@@ me out .
i &apos;ve tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to re@@ store health after a disease .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but the reality is always un@@ predic@@ table .
it was something we knew to do .
you should tell me something about my brand .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
it &apos;s hard to create a thousand square kilometers .
third technology : categ@@ ory .
my fourth technology : conditions for complexity .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
but so many help over the years .
life had &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
and my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but it has an un@@ expected turn .
and let me show you a simple example .
i work in the solar technology industry .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
well , i walked to the court room .
here , there &apos;s the chance to do something .
i remember as if it was yesterday .
the three words are : remember ?
we still think they &apos;re pri@@ tial .
i thought i could integra@@ te myself .
so that &apos;s what the super@@ market is .
here are some on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
now , this carto@@ on makes some few ements .
seriously seriously con@@ at@@ ist to the ground !
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
and if not , dance your dance .
the la@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked with red .
anyway , they do that in it .
the phosp@@ hor@@ problem is much more critical .
this is being ced in china in a second .
but everything that &apos;s in it is useful .
all of those is com@@ able about it .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go on a slide again .
our goal was to say , okay .
and in the time , you can re@@ act something different .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
but i didn &apos;t get out of that .
this one to to the bottom , to zero .
the internet and its service is a wonder .
we need to apply for more research fun@@ ds .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
my grand@@ parents placed number to 70 .
they were just like the people in this room .
we got rid of which didn &apos;t work .
embar@@ ras@@ bing . sh@@ ame .
it &apos;s like a po@@ ta@@ to .
let me show you close close .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
what we want is to create the future .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population .
so go on ; save the shoes .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality happens in many different forms .
so that made sense , it fit .
so again , that worked really well .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and this is a milli@@ million conc@@ ert .
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody completely intui@@ tive .
i think i may have heard more hands .
mot@@ ors , businesses -- four possibilities .
no one has to give your ideas to your ideas .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is about the details or the colors ?
and then it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the different images .
and here each piece is designed very designed .
scot@@ t talked from man to human .
we are more than that , citizens .
yet we seem to be quite happy .
we create new ten@@ sions and conflict .
then he wh@@ is@@ is@@ per into my ear .
what would you tell someone who thinks that ?
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
and this is very important in medical research .
there can be a series of changes .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
so you can &apos;t put them them around wrong .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
ini@@ tially we &apos;ve just sig@@ ned .
that &apos;s the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
and they had to take them them , which we were doing .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
now i &apos;m going to do some head@@ thing about this .
because the subject of ec@@ ology is global .
there &apos;s every foot@@ print print .
pic@@ as@@ so : , wait .
nobody one did this in the world .
and , you have smart smar@@ grid grid .
what is food food ? &quot;
every morning , they &apos;re flying 1@@ 40 miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly 1,@@ 40 miles .
i &apos;m &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
i was totally science , you know .
they live with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
that becomes a key element of this to@@ y .
what do you think what happened to these design students ?
let &apos;s pre@@ tend if we have a machine here .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
in the back there is someone who had a childhood .
now normally i would pick out the need@@ le .
thank you for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
it was almost beyond imagination beyond imagination .
teachers teachers didn &apos;t know something changed .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
ladies and gentle@@ men , your relationships .
so two ples , each one knows a baby .
so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
so i think we must be leaders .
on the left side you &apos;s a little boat .
what do you think the answer will be ?
nobody wanted to want to do with the movie .
these things have a positive effect .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
first is a classi@@ c , apple .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
i mean , nobody has ever seen partic@@ le .
the rest of time , they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true .
it has a butt@@ on , / off .
the next week , it comes to the market .
today , a lot of people have given and@@ the government .
and try it again with another generation .
story@@ story@@ telling is more and more of a sense .
first of all , i thought that this was a game .
then i wonder , how could that happen ?
and we keep continu@@ increasing our expec@@ tations .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and i went back to work .
the question is why people accept it .
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and security .
we always tried to ask major questions .
i start with some simple examples .
like the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
&quot; great , i said . set up .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they don &apos;t invest time in power fighting .
what happened that we could do that .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ ks .
why do we do ? why do we ?
it was summer and i had shor@@ es .
and of course , what what did is , it &apos;s made click .
i &apos;d like to show you something first first .
that &apos;s how they communicate that &apos;s how your fing@@ ers walk .
so i spoke to a conference a few months later .
i &apos;m never want to make anything different in my life .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
but the best part is coming -- in a second .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there had to be another puzz@@ piece .
that we contribu@@ to contribu@@ te to the system is the vot@@ ction .
at 16 16 i started illu@@ strate books .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
notice two things on this cur@@ ve .
do you know what to call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
i put them , and i went to the treatment .
it suppor@@ ts others talk about their mistakes .
and this argument makes no sense .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and everything is pac@@ ka@@ aging or content .
so not saving , elimin@@ it , avoid .
so every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
so smar@@ t-@@ grid , a huge issue everywhere .
instead , &apos;s look at the environmental model .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve sum@@ mar@@ i@@ up .
that &apos;s a problem many players have .
and i argue that that is good .
four and half years in it@@ al@@ y .
and we need to make a lot better in this device .
and what i say is very important .
actually no , that was the mistake at all .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
and still have a real level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
so there are a couple of really interesting develop@@ ments .
we want to do something about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
it becomes a challenge to offer that for nine .
he , over the country , going to roll on you .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make you crazy ?
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation .
everybody who were like this started to divi@@ de .
he came to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
now everybody tries to see from this pattern .
and i &apos;m going to sum that for you a quickly .
technical circu@@ are as well .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want .
there was a lot off and i was in ei@@ ry .
we don &apos;t have identity , we inv@@ ent them .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to human .
come , dance with me . thank you .
at the beginning the tri@@ b@@ al al society through language .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted him here .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
it has a molecular wei@@ um of over 300 million .
this is a completely sustainable development pattern .
you seemed to see it in the news .
and in that head , there was was was remem@@ ber@@ ded .
we understood the weather is global .
and what &apos;s it like in there ?
in countries where people get to money .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
they rever@@ turned the flow of water .
and that found what i was incredibly exciting .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
what would it be to live longer in good good health ?
i have something i want to show you .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
store it , fix the rest .
i wear je@@ ans , almost the time .
so they were just building blocks for him .
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
these tun@@ a@@ are all around , almost .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
so that was a very strange experience .
did you all your tam@@ ins this morning ?
there didn &apos;t have can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ i mel@@ ons .
as i said , am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ ce .
both are survival , both both er .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
all right , what is the brand ger@@ ry ?
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands have done .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
no apple has ever been ed ed like this again .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the lab@@ el .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
writing writing dna was an interesting step .
the sil@@ ence is num@@ thetic .
we want to lower the number of pris@@ on@@ mates .
and we also seen this in mobile phones .
and provide feedback to my sen@@ ior cian .
one one thing i thought he had kid@@ ney st@@ ones .
the head@@ quar@@ is right here .
there are ones that are much more tial .
in fact , coal is not dir@@ ty .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
yeah , so what should bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
that means we must get phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and we see that it works through .
if you fall in love with somebody . efficient ?
not everything &apos;s supposed to be com@@ pos@@ , of course .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you can still match them as well .
these were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
fl@@ amin@@ gos eat sh@@ ri@@ mp .
i think first is curi@@ osity .
that started the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
now they understood the advantage of prototyp@@ ing .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
this investment in africa the last 30 years .
there seems to be an dis@@ consi@@ sten@@ ency .
now would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
and that &apos;s not just true in terms of gender gender .
but how do you do that in practice ?
here &apos;s the results we just received .
so that they can understand the whole movement .
it &apos;s something like our battle scre@@ am .
because on the way , our problem would be even bigger .
do you know how many people look watching these ted@@ talks ?
the answer will probably be no .
they didn &apos;t want to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
we found it was really strange .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so i think the principles are very simple .
i did my job at 95 pounds .
good night , swe@@ et th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines . &quot;
so every dro@@ p@@ let was a little bit different .
you said , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
and i becomes a character in the book .
i remember like it was yesterday .
we have access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology .
all of all together , mistakes are inevi@@ table .
so you don &apos;t lose very common animals .
they get r@@ rare because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but dec@@ down is not always a bad thing .
this is foot@@ age of a si@@ x-@@ six second period .
so we damage about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
if your job is dan@@ cing , dance dance .
and they also also feel your movement and na@@ lt .
now he puts a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
i can turn the sequence as it walk down .
or they didn &apos;t have any phot@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
the whole is a game , i have to say about that .
it &apos;s about a behavi@@ rate po@@ e print .
and in my you@@ th , i said , expec@@ tation .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
on interpretation is har@@ ely about in beginning class .
to create a phr@@ ase with its own breath .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
he &apos;s just dec@@ dec@@ ei@@ ing you and he &apos;t dec@@ ke yourself .
because we can &apos;t live without those lies .
because this man is not interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
is great , then we have a business model .
for na@@ than@@ iel : music is mental health .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low must be up top .
well , i understand that . i do .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
probably many of you in in room room know this trick .
... that also , the do@@ ses are a role as too .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
it &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
we don &apos;t want to try to say before about the future .
look , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking .
how could it possible to do this ?
they &apos;re not about god and the nature of god .
each pol@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
i learned that everything is different in a moment .
and this is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net .
let me tell you how we found this .
you know , i came up with the idea for a movie .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about ?
or are they rather a down@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ te ?
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
and finally , let &apos;s wel@@ ce transpar@@ ency .
and that was an experience of hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and all of this leads us to one big question .
i made a decision to the united states .
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
and we use this word with this con@@ temp@@ t .
the transition happens . we can feel it .
she had the last word in every family argument .
money , not de@@ bt bt , affect the out@@ come .
good , really good , maybe a all@@ -@@ star .
i was a tremendous obs@@ essi@@ onal student .
and that was not a hard diagno@@ sis .
when you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
and the world we lived looked like this .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually doing this this right now ?
they visu@@ alize reality , and that &apos;s without the computer .
from the vi@@ an age to the machine age .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i had a relationship with that beauty over several months .
you do something actually a slightly different .
so basically my two passi@@ ons went ged .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
there creates a connection , mu@@ tual respect .
i thought we &apos;ll fix the po@@ x .
but do you know what they &apos;re not right to ?
but one of them is far worse than the other .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.@@ 5 billion players .
8@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
but are we we going to make the best out of our play@@ field ?
we see the same thing with the ability rights movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just just nat@@ cy .
there &apos;s quite a lot of crazy crazy things going on .
em@@ c : come transpar@@ ency .
here we were , and this is the painting .
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time we know that that &apos;s not possible .
we have all navi@@ gation systems in our cars .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
this is the call center for service and information .
now now we &apos;re doing this with dri@@ ll@@ ers and machines .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
we want to elimin@@ out mass capacity . &quot;
thank you for having at ted . thank you very much .
that is mo@@ ore &apos;s law for the last hundred years law .
we have the passion of a diet inno@@ v@@ ator .
she didn bar@@ ely brea@@ thing , and she was blue in blue .
that &apos;s the kind of edu@@ cational sh@@ ame .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and therefore , it &apos;s not percei@@ ved as a huge loss .
if you want , creates creates hyper@@ links between the images .
do you know what the answer to that question ?
i may have another 40 working years in me .
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language lear@@ ers .
the first question is , are we too many ?
but you won &apos;t replace phosp@@ hor@@ us replace the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
so we walk away , and where are we going ?
and some of it worked and some don &apos;t .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
the people in the door door are coming in now .
i &apos;ll agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
do you want to be more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
the dog ! i was l@@ ol@@ stic .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is being completely over@@ al@@ u@@ ated .
it was &quot; e@@ forever , forever . &quot;
a little more about you that are not you .
and what was that for you ? what was it successful ?
we &apos;re now far away from that dest@@ ination .
when i say reality , i mean photograph@@ o-@@ reality .
the under@@ water part comes from a stone through .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
here is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic .
the kid in me is really excited about these kinds of possibilities .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty question is an interesting question .
it seems it &apos;s important to me to uni@@ te both .
there &apos;s a program that some may know .
we all born . we birth children .
and we rein@@ vent ourselves as we want .
then i say , thank you very much , right ?
have a nice nice example .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make any stat@@ ement about reality .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , patent stuff .
and it was after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of human life .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board staf@@ f .
these are people who shape my world view .
my mother suff@@ ered alp@@ ght@@ dreams of the boat .
and yet we don &apos;t understand understand possibilities yet .
you know he was here in 18@@ 35 .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for re@@ ception here .
there &apos;s also lucky there have a whole lot of studies .
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
this player is just before an epi@@ c vic@@ .
these results were done through several weeks of hard work .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
it also shows in other parts of the book .
and i went over and just stopped .
maybe i didn &apos;t want be the appropriate doctor .
each of these five areas need at least 100 people .
that &apos;s how i think we &apos;ll play games today .
... could you just brie@@ to show the slide .
you can say things here that influence around the world .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very love . &quot;
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
and we learn trust and the rules of play .
the first two ases , they are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
lo@@ gic gic no matter what the true .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
what we left us is story@@ telling .
we can continue these things in different examples .
do that and then experience the sentence .
now that shouldn not a jo@@ ke at actually , but .
so please listen when a music is played .
and that &apos;s just a little bit the message .
how many would decide for good memory ?
then imagine two other little little changes .
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spre@@ spread .
well it turns out they &apos;re right .
so you go go and start start inv@@ ent .
go and touch leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot;
his whole process has changed that .
and we &apos;d like to look at now .
that means the ants wei@@ gh much more than us .
that &apos;s such the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
so you could feel like selling it .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ over@@ al@@ u@@ ate the destruction .
so my way of making movies changed completely .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here &apos;s some natural fire@@ flies .
because they have special process@@ or cap@@ abilities .
we called it the digital water pa@@ vil@@ li@@ on .
there are some places that we can turn to .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
these are spo@@ sted and strange programs .
i said , &quot; go out , grand@@ a . &quot;
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of er@@ r@@ ors .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
i &apos;m very forward to conver@@ sa@@ tions with you all .
and the third area , it actually explains itself .
and then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
there &apos;s no over@@ population problem in trees .
&quot; look at her belie@@ es , p@@ ink .
you have to be ready to take such risks .
we did practice with the same students .
and i took a while to figure this out .
we didn &apos;t have children paraly@@ sis in this country yesterday .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classi@@ cal expres@@ sions of play .
they shared the king@@ dom into two legs .
this is another look at the tree of life .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue .
they moved to a natur@@ alist concept .
think of a so@@ und@@ less airplane .
he says , &quot; ready for bang . &quot;
so we start with a windows windows car@@ p .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic .
how much money is it need to be able to realize this ?
you can look around in all these these muse@@ ums .
zo@@ om in it . you can go in .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le pieces .
they were lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s were been looking for .
and we created an i@@ pa@@ ap@@ p .
so he got the citizens to check them .
the more it changes the faster it changes .
so these women met and just talked .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
child mortality by a tent@@ h .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
but these are all the roads in the united .@@ a .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them , we re@@ pa@@ red them .
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a little la@@ d .
not just bad , but the worst worst ever .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and s@@ hr@@ in@@ ds in summer .
but the volu@@ me are much bigger than ever before .
clean coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
i can &apos;t say it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
so , climate is going to be terrible for you .
those who who make scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive tra@@ p .
and here are two patients . these are their record .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , powerful , powerful .
they teach them to open do@@ ors .
how would you want to be better than they are right now ?
if you &apos;ve given something , , give it now .
play is the ti@@ ck that eng@@ es us .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ g your inner child .
they can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bom@@ b .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
that is the con@@ sequence we need to ask .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ te ?
i see no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different types of br@@ ers .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
and i see the same process in combin@@ ing photos .
so in other words i define what i want .
the only problem was she had 10 children .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the old man &apos;s &apos;s grand@@ father was re@@ f@@ ed .
you get a model that comes out of all the earth .
and it &apos;s also ro@@ ot@@ deep in our lives .
you may have heard we &apos;ve built water@@ sig@@ ns .
we &apos;re now using on fourth generation fu@@ els .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are true to each other .
every society is driven by a primary medium .
so how do we work when we look into there ?
that &apos;s also there , and it comes back .
how can i make something most user friend@@ ly ?
and less less us@@ able or us@@ friend@@ ly it is .
it &apos;s a form of behavior , right ?
i will never play more more like right now .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned how to sing ?
and at all , you worked much less than me .
because artists have a dist@@ ur@@ ted ra@@ ti@@ o to lie .
we re@@ back to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
also the energy cycle for you you very important .
where &apos;s the biggest interest to actually do this ?
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
we walk into the poor of plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
mani@@ ok is something half a billion people eat .
the life life itself has no voice in this choice .
i mean , i r@@ ar@@ ely seen so flat lines .
you &apos;ll never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
as a result , we &apos;re building stron@@ ger social relationships .
and these were basically the first human developed game devices .
it was an extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
here &apos;s the current version of this talk .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open do@@ ors ?
and no , it &apos;s not burning man or san francisco .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
so gender can occu@@ r in many different vari@@ ties .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment , the head sho@@ b .
well the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
and in the world everything made sense to me .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and i think there &apos;s almost almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with it .
are you eight ful and mon@@ den@@ n like 00@@ 7 ?
we should put the bear bear in the c@@ age .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular fri@@ day ?
this year , it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so the occu@@ py@@ es@@ ia movement has done it .
at one point the screen is filled with leaves .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
he described one of them as &quot; very ordinary . &quot;
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
paraly@@ sis is a series of too many choices .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
i &apos;d love to do this work that i love .
and everybody knew that it worked that way , right ?
i &apos;m still going to keep on , because that &apos;s my job .
and &quot; ol@@ Ã© ! &quot; &quot; for you all of this .
this is an active film waste .
as i said , two of of , it &apos;s only started .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s more to my glas@@ ses .
because we don &apos;t we don &apos;t free things more of it .
in reality , the no@@ des are very va@@ gue and inse@@ rate .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so i knew many fish in my life .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
pi@@ vo@@ t you can immer@@ ve into a decade .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restri@@ ke yourself .
b@@ g : energy through is the most important .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
the biggest difference between you is dealing with time .
now we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a scientist .
so i say , let &apos;s the worl@@ d-@@ changing games .
is it relevant for others or is it for us ?
it steel every five of hope from my consciousness .
well , chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
how do you ju@@ dge people because of their characteri@@ atures ?
fr@@ ance does an gate . it@@ al@@ y does an gate .
now , today , we know everything about where our things come from .
well , we introduced the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ hole .
how would you change your rela@@ tions , and change the negative energy in it ?
we &apos;re talking about about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great great villa@@ ges .
it &apos;s not even online . no stre@@ aming .
and , city designers and construction ers as well , are very interested .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s still put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ be .
&quot; isn &apos;t , &quot; turned to to be true .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the su@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital is ting the physical .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
the cell communities started to abstra@@ ct information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
but i really believe that there &apos;s something coming after us .
30 years ago , this would have ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
now he &apos;s on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
we had no words for what we started .
in the future , most crime are are going to playing online .
and the question is , is this good news or bad news ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in that gold fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ ve what &apos;s in there in a second .
a se@@ me@@ ster of research issue , natural natural user design .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
i &apos;m going to take it out for you and explain him for you .
this const@@ ant feedback , there &apos;s not in the real life .
you don &apos;t have to spend much money to look great .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as other br@@ ands .
what me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ sis have they through ?
so you just go to google t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
we know one more where all the sta@@ tions are .
the next step was to find the app@@ s for this .
it says , &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so growth rate is acceler@@ ating .
in both cases they they had surgery , and they were doing well .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
many of you are covered by faces and etc .
no , the thro@@ away is exactly the right thing , right ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
i sell s@@ ums across the country , worldwide .
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
now , how do people die as a result of a such stick ?
these are spaces that can respond to a human .
that &apos;s just about wei@@ gh and wei@@ gh .
manhattan manhattan project ? how do we target ?
1@@ hundred m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m going to hold the kni@@ fe just like that in my mouth .
so it doesn &apos;t really work for the memory itself .
so much te@@ sto@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no response to that .
both cases grab@@ me me , asked me up .
i can &apos;t play today today in 20 years .
this is the har@@ dest part in my talk .
so bla@@ ause says there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
i was actually obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep sea .
many talk about an 80 percent redu@@ ction to 20@@ 50 .
we were just an@@ ing around there the way that we did .
i &apos;m not a robot robot ; i &apos;t always do things all the time .
so that &apos;s exactly what is lar@@ gely our dest@@ ination .
when we start thinking about this , that changes everything .
as a child i constantly drawing com@@ ic books and stuff .
throughout that journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
our steps in di@@ gi@@ zing life were exponenti@@ al .
we have abstra@@ abstra@@ ct an abstra@@ ct language .
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
it &apos;s just brea@@ cul@@ ingly ambi@@ tious .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and of course , how design design influence on perception .
so how does a human deal with certain things appropri@@ ingly ?
that means , crimin@@ al rates are back with that .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
there he scre@@ w@@ w@@ , , and he like , right ?
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i &apos;ve worked in a coal min@@ coal plant -- dangerous .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
... it pay attention at crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
it could happen within a learning model .
and yet there &apos;s this mental connection .
they put it to the venti@@ ators machine .
she had suff@@ ered a un@@ treat@@ able able of in@@ damage .
mean@@ , there &apos;s a political dis@@ pu@@ ce in our country .
what &apos;s the the age of so nan@@ ous machine age .
just like it just happened in the back in the village .
everything beautiful in life is not efficient .
i said , &quot; chicken chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
ask questions , demand evidence , demand for evidence .
i know what people think when they see this .
ok , so think of this as extreme extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
but we know very little about where the things go .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s even deeper .
this is really extraordinary honor for me .
it was the mis@@ led cross cross against drugs .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
and the fish was lucky enough to be still there .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
this is an organis@@ m described in 199@@ 6 .
fro@@ sty , the carbon gets cle@@ aner every day .
re@@ frame america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly the same happens that i just described .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
i was there there a long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
this was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
that &apos;s great . i love plac@@ e@@ bo .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain explain him .
and that is actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
but actually , that night that night it was a even more fun .
the idea is to che@@ list a digital security system .
click , and hu@@ um , you &apos;re in this museum .
because the pictures made it feel for real for real .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
combin@@ bine , but can you create something something special like this .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
rat ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
we &apos;re seeing the process that fe@@ ves on itself .
it slo@@ down for none of our big problems .
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to want ?
now because they don &apos;t know that it used to be different .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication .
it &apos;s called called the auto@@ matically bon@@ ding stone .
we had to worry worried about the law@@ yers and so on .
it caused men@@ se bi@@ ws in the control room .
it &apos;s like asking someone to wal@@ low the sun .
in 25 years , it will gone from here to here .
so that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
so i know from some people who haven not agre@@ in .
one a baby needs about six thousand thousand thousand a@@ pers .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really serious are you really serious ?
he lived lived nine and 30 years .
so the musical instrument is the exten@@ sion of our body .
however , in , in the &apos; 0s 0s wasn &apos;t the that .
and we created a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and so it es@@ cape from his tor@@ zing states .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
it &apos;s this lo@@ ding , coo@@ iled fla@@ vor .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a spon@@ ge .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i &apos;m going to step back , and i take the take the view .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening opening sequence of the film .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
well , energy power has fallen over time .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
di@@ ph@@ battery , ro@@ bes , child paraly@@ sis ...
you can just name some names and people will understand .
they were asked to report about your pain every 60 seconds .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
can you imagine something good coming from tab@@ bac@@ co ?
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive jo@@ ker .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
when we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
we can do the same things actually with less energy .
so we should better better figure out what the goal is .
i fil@@ med in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
but what if you want to see the pain@@ t@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
but what is the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
as you can see , these are not three special images .
i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
so in certainly , technology over@@ ws ws us .
she was a tough , strong woman , she was effective .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
the bro@@ b@@ ers describe them as un@@ tou@@ ched .
some years ago , i started developing li@@ rt vi@@ its .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a big sele@@ choice .
why do they adverti@@ around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn not perfect .
it &apos;s also my big , life@@ fel@@ long love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect that will ever change .
please follow me because the circle will will close .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read it , are serious .
and i think technology becomes increasingly important in our modern societies .
and even today , we still hang very , , very deeply on stories .
that &apos;s the period of time that you fall in love with .
and as we grow older , the win@@ a@@ bigger getting bigger .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pet .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
what we need is a lot of companies companies work on this . hundreds of hundreds .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
they to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
that &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ debate . it has to stop .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s happening here .
and my talk today will be main@@ ly about these cognitive cognitive fall .
i mean , how much do we to@@ e from our memor@@ ies ?
and that from an econom@@ ist . so it &apos;s logi@@ cal .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
i was fascin@@ ated by the ce and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
so i like to s@@ mile and i say , &quot; thank you very much . &quot;
imagine these ima@@ points could really start to fly .
one of mine did it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
you could use ordinary design technology to spread .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you know , we hear a whole lot about transpar@@ ency .
open the map , and jump it with a click .
that &apos;s the really cool part called colle@@ ction .
well , i play with you sometimes , but not very often .
but my logi@@ cal side didn &apos;t like it .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
50 percent of your decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried that you &apos;re losing space .
ah , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w !
if a neighb@@ or helps the other , we streng@@ then our communities .
call &apos;s call the beginn@@ er , it costs a lot of money .
what is this new state that the world is beginning to ing ?
in fact , we &apos;re also such a mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular community .
my grandmother was strong , but she was lo@@ vely .
my un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol duced diseases .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to pre@@ fer against in@@ justice .
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
we also brought live leb@@ its to design schools .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really amazing . thank you di@@ gr@@ lations .
i just want to say for a little bit about about sal@@ ate res@@ sing .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
like al@@ ga@@ e and other sc@@ fying things .
i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to replace replace the oil with other energy ri@@ ers .
and also what you would think in the mind .
and then immediately immediately think that &apos;s un@@ fair .
so the p@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he hi@@ cked .
system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
so there should better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
these are lots of ths by meas@@ ks , 20 per hour .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all it .
and i hope you look enjoy that . thank you very much .
the more money you make the happy you are .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
only that i think he &apos;s more like , isn &apos;t right ?
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
and the film will be &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going from by stat@@ ds .
this i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be out of that .
and i thought , &quot; wait that sounds interesting . &quot;
for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
secon@@ dly , combin@@ ed photos should have the same type of ligh@@ light .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has magic .
ten minutes later the ju@@ dge announ@@ pause .
that all our survival , with each &apos;s survival is lin@@ connected .
we have the capital of tech@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could well eat them .
but you , if you yourself a exten@@ tch .
somewhere are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is the publi@@ cation we &apos;ve just comple@@ comple@@ the very recently .
that &apos;s 20 feet of sea level , just as green@@ land .
we &apos;ve moved moving before in what &apos;s called the vi@@ an age .
i can say the can@@ z@@ ler is a man .
it has a food map of 15 to one .
here is a picture of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
a very specific wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
now , your life self is not going to be happ@@ ier .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for here in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve been given all sorts of recogni@@ tion .
this approach app@@ true for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
it was completely closed that she could fail to fail .
&quot; because you &apos;ve keep you this morning , &quot; &quot; he said .
and they were ligh@@ ting the way through the rest of the book .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two two billion people online .
we talk about a 300 when a bat be@@ ats 300 .
and all all the time i colle@@ cted more and more knowledge .
i studied wife &apos;s prin@@ ter , and she was brea@@ breath .
and this was the first time i learned this myself .
i now know it was the cause of the sea .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange .
we &apos;ve now in h@@ oll@@ and for three years .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency efficiency .
yeah , this one one looks see there that &apos;s the load .
and immediately i see a different pattern that turns up .
so that really really up@@ ck with me , and i wanted to want more .
the fact is that this un@@ certain@@ ty should worry about .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ins in para@@ ise .
this trick you can present to your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
they interact in clearly interact with their environment and their experiences .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
there are many more , but i lack time .
each of these the@@ mes , of course , many , many small decisions .
and this video was actually actually finished in janu@@ ary .
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
even who kill@@ s somebody is not just a mur@@ derer .
a couple of months went over , and i &apos;d just for@@ gotten everything .
according on its behavior , we can predict predict the structure and the function .
a result of that was that the phone was never broken .
b has these benefits benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so the people in the west have spent a long time about creativity .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t seem human human anymore .
so from the same , bad team became one among the best .
how can we apply these feelings from games into reality ?
players are ma@@ sters in spi@@ ders of se social we@@ inge .
when you &apos;re happy you engage other happy people .
obviously , this &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
and i celebra@@ te , i c@@ ry like a little kid .
and the deeper i talked , the more i should tell .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to become more efficient .
and of course they can never be in germany . &quot;
that &apos;s all all all at in the phase .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents all died when they were 60 .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s to it .
or want to be fit@@ ter , stron@@ ger , have more power .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;ll talk about in a minute .
amazing er@@ ror rate . one out nine nine inno@@ cent .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
it is , they want to the end of the gang .
i had a 14@@ year-old , poor poor black boy as a cli@@ ent .
we used to things happen lin@@ ear .
this is somebody who , the way , , , going will hits four of 10 .
very r@@ ar@@ ely you actually become planes of a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
i &apos;d want to share with you two examples , maybe three three examples of this .
you can throw them away where they go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire defen@@ de .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
wel@@ come the fear . wel@@ come risk come .
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well there are possibilities .
they did that by they de@@ est@@ off the country .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so the device you see that didn &apos;t work .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
the things that are used go into technical systems .
and as i turn the finger changes its position .
are they close ? they look a little nervous .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
so , if you could turn on the light .
then let &apos;s project this analog@@ y into the future .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ billi@@ dollar dollar brand .
so nothing has changed , and yet everything has changed .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and i think it makes the world looks like .
secon@@ dly , what econom@@ ists call op@@ op@@ tun@@ isi@@ ation costs .
i apo@@ logi@@ that i have to cut so much .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting as well , is of vision .
we see that that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
everything that beautiful in life is not efficient .
there is a direct re@@ nam@@ m system .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music ?
now that &apos;s already in the first year , lo@@ ses half of his value .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering colle@@ collective .
we &apos;re talking about the cape of information flow of information .
and i trans@@ aded them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
it has moments moments of life , one after another .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
looks pretty like , like ol@@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ bly language .
and what i was that i needed an exper@@ .
now , where would you position your brain on that scale ?
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s who are watching this video .
all yeah , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
typically , software usually takes a few years .
because this &apos;s where the actual government work is happening .
we need to focus on the machine ery of government .
the cost of solar energy fell by 50 percent by 50 percent .
i would send her home without talking to my ob@@ ti@@ cian .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn not a poetry .
and i guess that a lot of you have done that .
i believe it and i feel like we should teach this .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it still ells good .
how many do@@ ors has the house that you live in ?
and other , another example is the ambi@@ tious , intelligent systems .
but also our perception ourselves , how do they dec@@ ei@@ ve us ?
so you help help along , ask about people .
i play explan@@ ining what these notes have to mean .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with insu@@ lin .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
he said he he don &apos;t know that . he &apos;m going to ask .
ever heard of a farm that feed animals animals feed feed ?
watch mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and that &apos;s what we should . our health system is mi@@ es .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we did all all .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ , i think .
when we looked at how feelings vari@@ ary with income .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
i say we &apos;re ready ready for our own epi@@ c game .
again , what potential do we want to call out ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , you &apos;ve bu@@ ried it .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought brought .
so you move around and make art instal@@ lations like this .
in the previous previous example was about finding finding details .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you now what &apos;s really a@@ wes@@ ome .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal side is saying .
you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
a typical wal@@ m@@ art off@@ you you 100,000 products today .
today we don &apos;t just find pleas@@ pleasure in something ; we &apos;ll mit mit .
i knew she had come to pass her .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of their eyes .
because her life depen@@ ded on whether they did the job right .
because all of these new technologies of today are themselves on themselves .
i say this because i believe that identity is very important .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
i was sho@@ cked and ar@@ med into the inside .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it turns out , dna syn@@ thes@@ zation is very difficult .
i started to think , i should just put the project in .
but yet , i &apos;m going to make it a little bit curious .
and most of all , to ask what what the right is .
because music is a language and a language is to communicate .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he dec@@ ei@@ ted you .
the first , it was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
that second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love history .
fish fish system , but also a bird reser@@ ve .
this was here . not a team had a stable structure .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ step step bon@@ ual there .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next few days .
what had ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
now , the memor@@ der itself is a story@@ t@@ eller .
we think about our future as predic@@ cted memor@@ ies .
we know money is very important ; goals are very important .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
for most of my activi@@ ties i have two hat@@ ps .
you see the person who wonder@@ wondering what &apos;s going inside inside .
i want to show you the recent project we &apos;re working on .
it rock@@ ps about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
but there was always a life cycle in pres@@ ent@@ ations .
that kee@@ ps us away and kee@@ lets us keep evol@@ ve .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of life .
the pilot set the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
i didn &apos;t argu@@ ed for two years with my wife .
so the driving force behind this is the cyber@@ ber super@@ power .
so gentle@@ sir , can you help me ? i need help .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
and we found that there was actually a relationship .
the words , as long as his friends , are now mo@@ king him .
makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
we have lots of cells that are no longer on on themselves .
so it &apos;s a quite amazing invention , if you think about it .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that formed their lives .
more and more people came in just because they were an@@ gry .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ the previous previous los@@ ses .
they put a blue to a green , and they can make light .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
she said it was like a th@@ under@@ air train .
&quot; do i look like i &apos;m just typ@@ typ@@ up a song ?
so when i put them next to side , that &apos;ll ves your interest .
and life lived in the coast region of british colum@@ bia .
so , for example , sha@@ ke the environment , drive less car .
we can , of course , can look at the waste arb@@ waste first .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind@@ a@@ pers ?
so that , so in any store , you can get things back .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ phones ?
but it , of course it &apos;s the sum very , , lots of ideas .
you can like to test it in your class@@ rooms after my talk .
it question the question , can you get that to zero ?
did a single person in the audience ever saw anyone die of meas@@ ks ?
please don &apos;t tell tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ignor@@ by by memory itself .
so you can ask : how happy is the life itself ?
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
just at pre@@ cise times points , you agre@@ agree .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if you don &apos;t do , somebody can take it away .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of micro@@ seconds .
so now we again used the time als again re-@@ fa@@ st@@ zed .
i thought technology should make magic magic and not kill .
sometimes i lose the balance , and a story to conclu@@ end .
i want to end with a story , which really really excited excited about .
because through marine prote@@ cted areas we basically create the past .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to get worse .
maybe this is an artificial of reading an e-@@ book .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful min@@ ker is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
if we over@@ power it , we can sh@@ h back a little bit .
when they walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted ted prize inn@@ inner .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a much later .
usually most people start to ori@@ themselves on the task .
they dar@@ their ur@@ ine . they almost never do .
we found this in the happiness of the living itself .
that will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
it &apos;s an fascinating ad@@ vent@@ vent@@ ure to go to .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of me@@ d@@ al .
think of this as a image point , a flying image point .
so the recor@@ wings were , &quot; oh that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one who could talk to the flight comp@@ ani@@ ons .
but in my humanity i also gave room to my e@@ go .
almost like we &apos;re pre@@ p@@ ing for it for our lives .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go that that .
you have to make 6@@ 2 different choices to completely design your car .
but where would the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bu@@ au@@ au@@ cy .
we all have to believe believe that we can &apos;t see .
innovation , creativity , development , are not just come out of our heads .
let me close with my own words : i remember .
there we have cases like this by dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and of course , we all share the same skills .
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ image data .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is choice to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what en@@ ables us modern progress .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement .
we record images of these mini@@ i big bang into dete@@ c@@ tors .
i must tell you , i think was a big mistake .
then the same happens in a good , fair conversation .
because he doesn &apos;t know what ha@@ ha@@ y@@ le he is to go go first .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . actually &apos;s it mi@@ gu@@ el .
it high@@ ces a rare gli@@ il .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it suppor@@ ted .
so the question is : can we do ? i think .
and as general term we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
i mean , what does anybody bring with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
this is the average size of a green@@ land ice e@@ berg .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
i had the mira@@ cle of not to die that day .
i really like your species , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in .
so you you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i i think they don &apos;t even come from the muse@@ ums .
car colors , foreign color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 possibilities .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
the less i sort of think about it , the intui@@ tive it is .
we could , of course reduce that by 10 percent , but what can do that ?
that means we &apos;re useful useful , not less dama@@ m@@ ful .
they feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the orig@@ ter .
they today have rene@@ w@@ able energy share of fif@@ 10 percent .
but while they &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about about these possibilities .
and this is the value of experience , this so simple exercise .
that &apos;s sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we produce constantly , and we respond and@@ ro@@ gens .
speed will be part of of the show which is pretty driving .
so let &apos;s jump to mom@@ a , again in new york .
how did he get looking for help in this particular way ?
and that means free access , meaning open and productive .
w@@ r want to help people who were con@@ vi@@ cted of inno@@ cent .
and i thought that becomes so heavy , so pain@@ ful .
this is technolog@@ y-@@ suppor@@ innovation innovation available today .
and the best part is perhaps what expe@@ cts us in health .
but the question i want to throw out is : why not ?
i want to help you to a particular aspe@@ of curi@@ osity .
i &apos;m brea@@ thing the audience consci@@ or un@@ consci@@ ously .
now he mentioned the miner@@ needs of phy@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
normally you &apos;re kind of wrong by wrong , and some come , some don &apos;t .
they invest a lot of their time in the assem@@ of ever@@ ually growing structures .
the first of these tra@@ ps is an con@@ cen@@ tion to ad@@ mit complexity .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , along with chimpanze@@ es , our next living ancestors .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to temp@@ &apos;s room .
you go around the block , and you take it as an epi@@ vel@@ any .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be people recei@@ passionate .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black .
here &apos;s evidence , by the way that men are not pig@@ s .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
ce@@ os are a little bit over@@ average . but this &apos;s where it gets interesting .
because frank@@ ly , every project has got its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play play games like this .
and i really want to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a law@@ yer .
the ju@@ dge thinks of him as adults , but i see a child .
and within a few years , le@@ go moved in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
here i &apos;ll scale it a bit . we look at the center right here .
so i decided when i was 15 to di@@ up .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion image points , i think .
six : social failure . speak@@ 7 : 65 dea@@ .
new investment to create well-@@ paid jobs .
fire@@ flies in a glass , i always always exciting to me .
from my eye , i saw the jan@@ it@@ r up and down .
the x interpretation interpretation of a piece is to this .
many many you you say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
long years ago , there were gra@@ y ales -- 500 years ago .
that means the player certainly beat three of 10 be@@ kes .
and they &apos;ve done this with what &apos;s called le@@ le@@ ad maps maps .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
okay , let me squ@@ ee@@ ee@@ a little bit of blood for you .
imagine every single single person is is driven by people .
and you guess what we found in the attac@@ ks code ?
if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
how about contribu@@ tions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
but instead of fre@@ ani@@ cked , he just stopped up .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had in the last half a year .
but somehow we &apos;re manage to get ourselves from this problem .
he invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
it means that we reach a cultural influence next to science .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , the individual people .
so i started working on , so when is something natural natural or intui@@ tive ?
but cru@@ cially is , if i &apos;m right , it just true .
i first ate him at a restaurant in southern ania .
what about child paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we hate too strong government . we have no trust in system .
we &apos;re putting ing games to get cape of the real world &apos;s suffering suffering .
we de@@ graph a man who has value for our society .
we fle@@ ed his bed so he can look outside .
here &apos;s a clip from of this ang@@ on code .
of course this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so maybe you should stand before before the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
i like things that are od@@ d . i like od@@ d things .
even this air@@ port has a area 100 square kilometers .
turn the tr@@ ash clay on the side . went home .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so flu@@ tive .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ depen@@ ds on all of our humanity .
5@@ 6 percent of ra@@ pes are not trial trial .
well , indeed , the number of non@@ violence hasn &apos;t changed very much .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better better . i couldn &apos;t fall myself down .
and , if we do that , can we laun@@ ch the chromo@@ some ?
so this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball yo@@ ff .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
that has actually adop@@ taken two thousand thousand eight really form form these , these networks .
i think it &apos;s of like a hundred dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very yellow ha@@ ck .
it goes much further back into the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
and then 10 milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
no more it takes to whi@@ st@@ le a song , or to sing ing .
from that time has an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you may might know .
there was the core research ty called le@@ o@@ pol@@ ar sha@@ port .
i asked him , how he turned to such a fish experts .
the system is so healthy , and it &apos;s completely self-@@ self-@@ no@@ vent@@ ing .
well , i wonder@@ ed , how can i really bring this over ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
well the life itself lives its life continu@@ ously .
well , the two types of self throw out two terms of happiness .
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ environment for these bacteria .
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
i brought seven couple of under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
but from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
it &apos;s predic@@ table -- like this strange high@@ road .
so it turns out to be very hard to get all of these exten@@ sions .
the greatest fear were had pi@@ pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
photographs like this : a building site along a much more ri@@ ate road .
somebody had collap@@ sed , and they had th@@ or@@ ly ha@@ cked the system .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a very complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the miner@@ als .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is you .
they increase paraly@@ paraly@@ sis and lower lower happiness .
in fact , nasa showed a lot of them out there .
and then , in my opini@@ on , was a very good code came done .
the interesting thing is if i can make a little trip .
and i &apos;m not sure that they actually stay there .
the compon@@ ent becomes increasingly becoming your friend with you live with with .
so finally finally was a company trying to make it right .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building exten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ inten@@ vely .
i grew up with a appropriate por@@ tion science fi@@ ction .
it &apos;s on average about five tons for everyone on the planet .
they produced the highest construction in the west time .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect from hollywood .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that is actually the true waste of human and machine .
the secret is that play is the key to these skills .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
now , that night , everybody went to the center to celebra@@ te .
and i said , &quot; how do you you communicate ? &quot;
so we created a device that is completely free of limit@@ ations .
why is it important to re@@ boot boot ? what does the red represent ?
an eight , distribu@@ played brand brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
finally , in scre@@ ing , we should wel@@ come fear .
so i was exactly what years ago a few years ago .
possibilities that had not allowed were been expres@@ tically encoura@@ ged .
for example , the fish was on a glass trip .
so find find programs that can the most likely to make numbers .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
how can a ju@@ dge turn someone into something they &apos;s not ?
how about a set of new voices , never listen@@ heard voices ?
essentially , the con@@ cre@@ te block had become the building block of our time .
5@@ 4 percent of death ths happened through dri@@ ll@@ ing .
the modern industrial world we know it is almost 300 years old .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
at the last ted conference , i gave a introdu@@ to the l@@ h@@ c .
and then we did a de-@@ of-@@ condu@@ ct .
so this is just one app@@ of lots of many that you can do with it .
that means you navi@@ navi@@ gate over sound and rhyth@@ m .
then these are fa@@ ding influ@@ ts of the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
the not@@ ted notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
so i ask , how sk@@ compe@@ tent this diagno@@ sis ?
this is a fish el@@ el@@ age in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables energy , as they often often called .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
this is my skin . this &apos;s not a special effect from hollywood .
my inspiration comes inspiration comes from an event that goes back 2,@@ 500 years .
ah , majority . i like like like , as a doctor .
but nothing was invented that would let me go , until now .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , changed my life .
and if they &apos;re at risk , really really bad things can happen .
what context does that mean the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed photos should have the same perspective .
this is my w@@ w@@ lan@@ &apos;s wa@@ age . a very simple thing .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
a kid in india says , &quot; today i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
i &apos;ve given a couple spee@@ talks in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany .
so here get the dra@@ matic high fig@@ ures come in prison prison on@@ mates .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular clay .
i looked in the ru@@ cket , and it was a little bit p@@ ink .
some of my c@@ kl@@ ks have happened over the last five years .
and the best part is that connect connect with magne@@ ts .
and the key indi@@ c@@ ator is the extin@@ ction of languages .
it &apos;s our new home country called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
most know , most people know this from the software field .
even if you shot ot now , you would have have emissions .
you learn to find the notes to the notes on the instrument .
there was no piano piano at b@@ , as an instrument as an instrument .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more one .
so i off@@ ered a $ 100,000 price of software for the w@@ inn@@ ers .
so i want to this machine , and i want to go into the future .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on gene@@ tically changed food .
at right moment it &apos;s in present right now , but we &apos;ve got an incredible opportunity .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph@@ .@@ student .
we develop to collabor@@ ative , passionate beings .
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ gen re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists that there &apos;s this test .
we find other other simil@@ di@@ ties in terms of what their rights are .
so these green areas , these are the most ctive environments .
these people will be connected to the movie forever forever -- forever .
it actually actually inclu@@ just just a period of two-@@ and-@@ two-@@ two weeks .
well , the film took a very big moment .
i don &apos;t know why they were doing it , but i learned something about it .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me say , thank ted .
and it &apos;s spread ted less@@ ly , organic , naturally , organic .
and so i believe that the ted community should be cop@@ per .
if someone &apos;s lying , they &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
i believe in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
you know what a 3,000 ter in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
and that &apos;s the news i took in medical school .
and late mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be be working .
this is our yo@@ un@@ test pa@@ board right on the right there .
that is the time of the most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
if we actually don &apos;t take a phosp@@ hor@@ us and give it off .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero .
the people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of many of these wonder@@ cles .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ skills and their combin@@ ation lead to success .
if you could have one one of them , it would be a completely different world .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
so we have in our culture a lot roman@@ roman@@ ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation facing us .
so if we do something about the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ves of it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
and just like that disappe@@ ared all these companies disappe@@ ared one after the other .
if they could do it for them , they certainly could also help me .
but on youtube , more more than 4@@ 8 hours video is u@@ plo@@ aded a minute .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most gical thing for me .
it &apos;s about creating over@@ flow of na@@ cold goods .
and i was good , i finished with c@@ um lau@@ de .
and when i listen@@ to her , she made coo@@ us@@ y sounds .
we &apos;ve spread live live to kids and see them play with it .
on september 10@@ th of last year , the machine started for the first time .
what were its conditions of life , like the ones of society and of politics ?
l@@ oud and mis@@ ble@@ tive , , f and b , et ce@@ ter@@ a .
the man is supposed to come from the mon@@ key or or have common ance@@ ance@@ or .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s viol@@ in@@ lin conc@@ ert .
and this is something we have to learn to learn very quickly .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i don &apos;t want to say to give a fish the same rights as a human .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
we want to use that as a possible se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;m just want to talk to tony again .
i like lots of black colors lots of gra@@ y notes and sort of stuff .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other is &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
three months later , i was moved , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ on .
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
i love this : &quot; wat@@ son forces human ene@@ pon@@ my . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely in@@ in@@ tive .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with that .
people said , &quot; &quot; are you afraid afraid never succe@@ ed ?
this is where , the more more you do , the better .
so the inter@@ play en@@ ables the growing of bon@@ ment , trust and each other .
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more be possible .
i think , mass mass car@@ mi@@ zation fundament@@ ally changed our world .
but at the same , we need a good intuition to actually do the experiments experiments .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
in the short time here , i realized : ted has an identity .
i got to the car , and was really over@@ wh@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ med .
so we &apos;ve for@@ god god a piece bit far to virtu@@ alize .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back .
i wanted us to live long and healthy life .
president 8 : ami war@@ ning . speak@@ er 9 : cyber@@ attac@@ ks .
because these are just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
often the music class is like you learn to read the notes .
even though it doesn &apos;t seem appropriate , play may perhaps the most essential .
now there &apos;s all this ru@@ m@@ um before of great un@@ vel@@ ation .
so we don &apos;t have have to control the people to be as bad bad .
and is to lies that you can just apply this lo@@ gic wrong wrong .
they just swa@@ trade to building a@@ part@@ ments the one of cities .
we &apos;re living on a planet that is 70 percent covered with water .
&quot; you remember the patient they sent home ? &quot;
the offi@@ cial belief of all western industri@@ alized societies .
they r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
they &apos;re good . the question is , how is it going to to us ?
you can only have zer@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions sions if you &apos;re not there .
but when i ask you , how are you with your wife ?
that was the very first beginning of a own musical expression .
because a good engineer has either building great cars or nuclear power plants .
it comes from from , from asia , in in case case from japan .
and there you can already , what enormous speed speed possibilities is there .
and thousands of studies have been done to see if that was true .
and i tend to see vulner@@ ability as my sha@@ dow .
we should be be able to ro@@ ct everything we want .
it &apos;s much more cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so i sat down , and you played the ted@@ talk .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to keep them apart .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology technology is doing .
it &apos;s said that the names names of people who die die you never never forget .
but what if the picture conne@@ them to all your images ?
mean@@ now , a lot of people are are working there , and they can all get enga@@ ged .
you colle@@ ther information about the piece of play in the dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
listen consci@@ ously and tell if they taste or not .
now why why i i asking from my audience that it &apos;s ac@@ ac@@ ac@@ as well ?
and as i say the word justice , that un@@ un@@ comfortable feeling is gone .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ pe before something occur@@ s into the body .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
under a hat , i work with the story of an@@ atom@@ y .
it &apos;s also also a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan , and a motion motion shot .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the london london london olymp@@ olymp@@ ics .
big data is trans@@ formed into organizations around the world into big opportunities .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
you agre@@ ed to him to fre@@ fre@@ ely to sha@@ ke if it &apos;s s@@ on@@ ing .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room star@@ ing at me .
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
if you do re@@ done and never make make mistake again .
what you need is an environment that will puts you in the position to do it .
he finished all whole thought and did something completely new .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
and that then respon@@ es in the head@@ words of open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
fundamental tool of information information has have been been been stories .
at right directly , we in these way we can get back nutri@@ ents into agriculture .
to keep tw@@ ins , directly with the com@@ pos@@ .
you learn learn learning to reading before you only one only one word .
if i don &apos;t be right , then the can@@ z@@ er is not a man .
let &apos;s start with question : how will we feed ourselves ?
why ? because we don &apos;t have paraly@@ sis . and you know what ?
a de@@ ception becomes into something because someone sees it like way .
not only only tell stories when we start telling stories .
and they get asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it was worse for a than b b in memory .
when we vie@@ about , , we enter@@ into into all sorts of un@@ in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
it was as it@@ al@@ y won the foot@@ ball world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
they knew all the bits and b@@ tes that they had to gras@@ b .
and nei@@ ther the engine leaders , nor the security system is going to notice it .
all par@@ ties , all the fra@@ ctions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
how good , you think , are you at over@@ el@@ ming the decisions ?
okay . anyone who &apos;s willing to adop@@ on g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
we can do deal with more categ@@ ories than with more choices .
we know know nine cities planning to use this ap@@ p .
it bring bring images and text , and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
sometimes these ideas rus@@ ahead to our thinking in a very important way .
br@@ y@@ an , they &apos;ve really s@@ a string string string here .
this is the result of the quick@@ est computers that are building fa@@ st@@ est computers .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors so forth .
because it &apos;s something that has lost in some lost .
and this is one of the three main sources of the exi@@ online problems today .
beyond the simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is quite powerful .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try explain explain to myself .
to put it my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
if your work went out -- not entirely entirely your mistake , right ?
keep be there for your contribu@@ , whatever he wants to be .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ on was to build lots of more coal fac@@ tor@@ ies .
i &apos;ve just written out four cho@@ here , and i &apos;d like to explain explain for a fly .
and look , how do we process process information , how do we use information ?
the meaning of the letters , you realize when you get the language about it .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
i said , &quot; no , what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds .
but even in this limited limited view we can do a lot of things .
and we became for a four and a a half years into a right family .
and that &apos;s a process of thought that i think is appropriate .
i don &apos;t say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are un@@ essential .
and all i can say about that is : why do we fight this ?
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
we know something about what determin@@ es the happiness of happiness self .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design video games .
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
the human genome project project began in 199@@ 0 , and it took us 13 years .
so how do we oper@@ alize the question for the characteri@@ stics of character ?
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole movie , from beginning to end .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
in the mean@@ time i prepared for a talk at ted@@ global .
every single one of you could be famous for the internet to next satur@@ day .
and today we we all feel ourselves as ow@@ ner of our pop culture .
the od@@ ds from the bar@@ les came from the rest of the world .
but this picture is actually actually completely com@@ together , of photographs of different places .
and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
and these app@@ s let us use our hands to improve our communities .
today we can point to to do@@ zens of companies who did this exactly this .
and i think that it begins with a medical cian , and who is me .
and reason for this : the government was able to track back where a text came from .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a phone phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
writing writing books is my job , but it &apos;s obviously more than that .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
this search led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and old ro@@ me .
and that &apos;s the most core thing of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
now now no longer at the local level , but on a global level .
and the main thing is to look at the ground , the first one .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go to go and take the nutri@@ ents along .
interpre@@ ters are trans@@ ators of the written notes in clinical music .
whether the music is too too ta@@ ff@@ ed , or too swe@@ ute ?
and then st@@ cks to@@ up up so to give them the vision .
and then he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire@@ department . &quot;
now this is a three sentence that tells us a lo@@ gic .
and if i &apos;m right , then the can@@ z@@ ler is a man .
because when water comes out , it goes ases in the atlan@@ tic .
and who &apos;s explor@@ on sees that this is true true especially with men .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fill it .
a nuclear nuclear re@@ actor that itself a solution to g@@ arb@@ age .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately the skep@@ tics live in very different cam@@ ps .
we type p , we sub@@ in , we go food , that &apos;s okay .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t cause cause and cor@@ relation .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the world &apos;s worst sho@@ les in of humanity .
we think that we &apos;re in in reality we &apos;re not as good as in games .
these are people who believe that as single person can change the world .
when we look ahead , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
talk to me about the &quot; why &quot; &quot; period -- what does it bring us ?
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says un@@ moving objects feel the same .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become become his check .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country . &quot;
this business , it was almost as like a pleasure park .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
photographs , which you have to spend for a a moment to think about in order to figure out the trick .
and there they developed great app@@ s , they worked with urban collabor@@ ators .
my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
by 20@@ 20 , we definitely go from two to five billion internet users .
&quot; do you remember of the patient with the red pi@@ cket ? &quot;
you might think that he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ds , but that &apos;s not true .
and at the end , they want to get the poor@@ able rema@@ ins .
this shows the tremend@@ gely big role of a marine prote@@ cted area .
it shows shows shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
almost hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out with this .
but there &apos;s a key difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
-- but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different metho@@ ds .
you ho@@ bine it to a particular note , and then you tend it to the hir@@ re .
this is of course high-@@ tech tech agriculture , but the plants are carrying itself .
so so the ham@@ mer heads in the piano are the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers .
this food process@@ ation from 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
nasa has a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
we love to cover ourselves in lies . we love that .
this is a photograph@@ photograph@@ er phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
there are 6@@ 8 million people sitting glob@@ ted worldwide in wheel@@ chair .
to adap@@ pt fully in in@@ comfortable world , we have to play .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a very phone call , they go to the toi@@ let .
but this happens a lot of un@@ useful transpor@@ ts and complicated things .
anybody seen the movie &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly and di@@ ving bell ? &quot;
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , friends , to people .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i think about the boat .
and , t@@ &apos;s &apos;s mother is is here in the fourth fourth or or fif@@ th row .
so it &apos;s about cap@@ ching an idea than really a moment .
i &apos;m going to start showing you a fly show one single bor@@ ing slide .
the united states today have the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
these are the questions that we need to deal with for the next 50 years .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see them here .
now , how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
if we go back from there , what would the 20@@ 20 stuff look like ?
now this is three weeks , and that &apos;s at least one and half hours .
i grew up with a mother who taught me day day day .
any paraly@@ paraly@@ can can actually communicate communicate with their eyes , or draw .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
so i made this thing in a similar way you making a computer chip .
it &apos;s not poli@@ tically active , this &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ active .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new lives .
because the frank@@ fur@@ facili@@ facili@@ ty best best re@@ gain the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
super@@ large forces with opposite posed fron@@ ot@@ sig@@ ns resol@@ solve each other .
then we have to break our mu@@ st-@@ run capacity on the net .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you b your fish ? &quot;
and from here i can go into the page and call them again .
the answer is , until we get to zero , the temperature will go up .
now this is basic al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take it through .
i really believe this , and no , it &apos;s not cr@@ k thinking .
the kni@@ fe fe you can exam@@ at , my hand that you can exam@@ ine .
end is very , very important , and in this case domin@@ ated the end .
and just like , shows you the ic@@ e@@ berg another side of its person@@ ality .
today , more than than ever , , we get a little hon@@ est@@ y very far .
this is &quot; the and@@ and@@ , &apos; &quot; in the national stal@@ gi@@ y .
and here &apos;s a really very large clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
maybe you may know , i have over 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds were already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
of course , my grandmother would tell all her grand@@ children , they were something special .
she said , &quot; what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
eventually i got out of my car and i walked up the irs to the court .
of course , many people , scientists , will con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
they also had to run a paper of of text from this writing writer .
that &apos;s one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life .
a art@@ work that you never look at there has no power to work .
it &apos;s only to see when you take a step back and look at the whole .
so &apos;s how we can jump and take look at all the ted prize inn@@ inner .
and so i &apos;d like to show you something else that could be a little surprise .
and it si@@ sitting there and burn for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
from the sight of the living himself , b clearly had a worse time .
so to these fantastic game game controll@@ ers there were she@@ ep des@@ ines .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ book .
so we decided to support tony -- temp@@ t -- and his thing .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes like a magic &apos;s board .
which is , of course , comes facing story@@ telling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
that di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , knowledge , made it available through the internet .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran divi@@ ded in 15 so-@@ called levels .
you could try to exp@@ tend the capacity of exi@@ sting sting part@@ ments .
and each living being uses exactly same letters and the same code .
fan@@ tas@@ y@@ books always had cards , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
we have two creatures both both mod@@ i@@ ed exactly exactly same day in the 197@@ 9 .
a little bit , because i &apos;m just going to draw a something on the paper here .
and i want to view this on the time scale of life &apos;s earth .
she said , &quot; honor ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and when he went out of the door , he showed at his ro@@ cket .
that has to do with going back to the four@@ ten@@ h century .
so a little bu@@ b , who &apos;s not really interested for fire li@@ ing .
and it proce@@ ds to nine billion to move to nine billion .
the first sentence is , sound says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
americans americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
the ur@@ ani@@ an is used gradu@@ ally , a bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
so i want to show you you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
because actually , we &apos;d have have to prove whether there &apos;s the sou@@ l or not .
different words : drug war , mass weapons of mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
re@@ store america with 100 percent clean electricity , over the next 10 years .
you &apos;ve heard heard of before about over@@ population problems of trees ?
the sou@@ l is such a thing , says lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
if you te@@ low that down somewhere , it takes take a while .
evolution does &apos;t necessarily means to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
imagine a big explosion explosion as you get up to 1,000 meters .
i remember seeing a kid playing playing on a floor p@@ wave .
oil is a problem , and coal is the the the biggest problem .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has campaig@@ ns .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , re@@ feed@@ clo@@ sion , vision .
there will be a whole lot of resi@@ stance and argu@@ argue .
it &apos;s not about hing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t even remember me .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the machine oper@@ ator .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; restri@@ limited . &quot;
mu@@ ed ed on top on the continu@@ ous picture of nasa .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
clinical depression explo@@ ded ded in industrial world in the last generation .
what has sc@@ u@@ ts on our based on our thinking and on our memor@@ capacity ?
in the ground over six percent percent of the carbon is stor@@ ed .
if you throw the wrong things , you &apos;ve got a waste problem .
you don &apos;t &apos;t need to make music anymore anymore if you bor@@ bor@@ ed with it .
so the next day , i called call don , just before the event .
a friend journalist had been ken about this fish for long time .
i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i enter@@ red these expedi@@ tions .
some studies studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
are we in some of evolutionary equ@@ bri@@ ity in the form of a species ?
so sex games are common , both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and as human beings .
and this gave us very insi@@ confidence to what we were looking at .
he typ@@ writing &quot; su@@ yl@@ ac@@ rat , &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
i don &apos;t know sure if i have time to show you other environments .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve have it for yourself .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your work of life .
in fact , it can feel feel par@@ an@@ or@@ mal sometimes .
but when you se@@ w@@ , , most of the drin@@ king water will fall away .
there are effects effects that you can change live live , such as rever@@ ation and fil@@ ters .
why don &apos;t &apos;t we sing anymore to come from from a to b ?
many use the word , but don &apos;t know know what it means in detail .
we make agriculture in brazil agriculture from where we get the nutri@@ ents .
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c is a bunch of or@@ phan@@ kno@@ .
all of this affected me , and all this also influ@@ enced my experience with the com@@ position .
i say , l , what do you need a big car ?
it &apos;s easy easy to check that it has very different in in meaning .
who can make a fish taste so good after it &apos;s been coo@@ ked ?
they don &apos;t exist in a sun@@ sun@@ based system , as we do .
these were care@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
why is it impossible in games to to think you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
we developed the game super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute of the future .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ p on his hotel room door .
now in practice , people aren &apos;t test for their chromo@@ some .
if all the answers yes , i feel like i won .
they &apos;re creating something like of like a water cur@@ tain with a points of points from water .
how would your consciousness hand@@ with that your body is in the room be oc@@ oc@@ alized ?
so if you think think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
and he doesn &apos;t really an idea . he starts with the animal beginn@@ er .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve improve citi@@ zen@@ ship .
this is a slide that i happened to pick choose from my fol@@ der .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or does in the connection machine .
and we bring them back , in a con@@ temporary story for children .
she was something that made that you always wanted to be near her .
but you can also think about it differently depen@@ ding on how we see our identity .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
and it worked for for a while until i met wife prin@@ ter .
and it turns out he stre@@ p@@ to@@ c infe@@ ction .
that meant that during the chinese invasi@@ on on was killed killed immediately .
but the spa@@ tial order of the images here is really significant .
does it allow possible to create these really large molecules that has never been done before ?
are you not afraid that the hu@@ mili@@ ation of a stat@@ ement kill you ?
the continu@@ ent co@@ co@@ very today with music is not pro@@ for that .
it &apos;s impossible to pres@@ enting things like things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing it , because the food is better . &quot;
we &apos;re not reali@@ stic , we enjoy . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
so i can zo@@ zo@@ om in in my course in a particular time frame .
and , instead of just just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ?
she wouldn &apos;t kill her child against paraly@@ sis . absolutely way .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
i take something that is obviously a de@@ ception , and i make it look real .
actually we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
she looks at him and she says , &quot; i &apos;m for super@@ sex sex . &quot;
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like humans -- love to play for their life .
i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ , how can that be ? &quot;
the pilot had wa@@ the machine already , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
there &apos;s only one , and these is the united states -- for happiness , for happiness .
so there &apos;s a big on each time , that &apos;s how to wel@@ come the risk .
there were already two cities built in china and the third is in prepared .
go from the few choices to the many , stay stay that .
but think in a way that integr@@ ated in our own life .
it &apos;s not about sc@@ ar@@ city , and the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
and it wasn not on my upp@@ mate doctor , he was very ar .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i send it home ?
they weren &apos;t e@@ aten , you thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
and then i took a ju@@ on ar@@ der and i it on it .
then came the next generation where we &apos;re actually live primary primary today .
you can only be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
but don don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand about classi@@ cal music .
so you become hear what you &apos;ve imag@@ thought in your mind .
and we can actually turn out with two milli@@ seconds with two big battery .
we now have three gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany .
that &apos;s what goes to two billion years of labor experience .
and i can sort of bring back everything i &apos;ve seen seen earlier today .
i left out times , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
he &apos;s just developed with some other people a ro@@ virus v@@ acc@@ ine .
you can see it a second , but you can also see away if you want .
or &quot; what was their journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; &quot; or something .
but the cru@@ cial in this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t been at@@ gra@@ ed .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are least known among the pri@@ mates .
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ iti artists in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and you know , that part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
now i can answer all of your questions , and give you an fil@@ ded sum@@ mary .
so to go really close , you can go down to the cra@@ cks .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a el@@ ev@@ ator ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , par@@ tion communities and the un@@ expected .
because you just do this called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain bear .
if you want to know it , these other spi@@ kes are also fri@@ days .
what turns could you have have written that you have something thing ?
but what you really do is to show what technology today with technology .
a zen helped a different zen , but the government played a central role here .
in other words , every step here is a poten@@ cy on performance scale .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s in virg@@ ini@@ a as a sla@@ ves .
197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in business ages and in prison .
but for afri@@ can@@ american in this country was a time of ter@@ ror .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ e@@ an politi@@ cian once said once .
there &apos;s got little fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the standard value .
they &apos;re designed to be light , t@@ one , engine and sen@@ sor .
i mean , don you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame that was recor@@ right .
a chromo@@ some , by the way is just a piece of organized chemical material .
you can see in the top that his chromo@@ some is just fall@@ tting apart .
it turns out that he just wanted stac@@ ack the pen@@ ables .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
in part , with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so these places , are in there .
because everyone &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody is talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
we example , we do this in china , where we directly take the waste of it .
as the interpre@@ ter of a music , i first have the the written notes .
when you add more wind together , the system begins to fail .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demon@@ stration that i &apos;ve given up to here .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a cur@@ se .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the kni@@ fe trick .
front of him there a gor@@ ge@@ ly d@@ ressed sho@@ w@@ girl .
and i want to say &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
now , today , our environment for the first time beginning to answer .
we need to con@@ front the consequences , and we start pre@@ p@@ are ourselves .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ os say it .
every single harvard harvard employees now auto@@ matically join te a li@@ fel@@ time fund .
because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t absor@@ up with your camera .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
so this now allows us to to work as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started argu@@ sing .
the basis for many of these are technologies , and they grow growing poten@@ tially .
he had a poten@@ tially thre@@ fel@@ ening disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
in these acts were a or@@ or@@ named called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her .
lights , dau@@ t@@ notes , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer from pla@@ ough that sc@@ ared in the dark .
and i promis@@ ed to come back to tell you how the machine works .
it &apos;s not at at all like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel !
and what interesting also is that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
i then say with my own words , what could be written between this frame@@ work .
he asked me what the introdu@@ ction of this bal@@ bar was for me .
so movies were the way to bringing images and stories . it fit together .
and with every trial , the kids immediately get feedback feedback what works working and what doesn &apos;t .
and the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t really see this . &quot;
i would cle@@ an@@ up my arm and show you there are no disappe@@ unds .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
the democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
we do it . so rational we are as as we value intelle@@ ct .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in the court room ? &quot;
it &apos;s much better this year . she &apos;s on the ris@@ ing ace .
how can i teach you my mistakes so they don &apos;t do the same ?
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
this is not electr@@ on microscop@@ e it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ e .
each has four four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ choose which you &apos;d like to use .
and if we can do this for w data why why not for content itself ?
because at a certain point , i &apos;d to say to myself , &quot; what am i doing here ?
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and we got mission to design a building to in the exp@@ o .
but the king of si@@ am got al@@ umin@@ um be@@ bri@@ cks .
and i &apos;m afraid of many more things that no one would experience .
so we were only only five people to re@@ build one around society .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which are birds for this place .
and so 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company an environmental conscious actually bought the country .
well , you know know about its size , but there &apos;s lots of un@@ certain@@ ty .
and after two , three days , it realized that she would never wake up again .
we all know what good about it , so i &apos;ll about what &apos;s bad about it .
and then it go back , and then it &apos;s actually seen first .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people to be as little bad .
and you can try this in words like ven@@ kes or w@@ ven@@ ction or something .
here you need some lo@@ gic , but need will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
that &apos;s what the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s going very rapi@@ dly everywhere .
co2 he@@ ms the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
and so they &apos;ve prepared the really wonderful way the future civil rights movement .
so we &apos;re in finding how to do it , faster and stron@@ ger .
this map gro@@ ws and lights ting for ori@@ ori@@ in the rest of the book .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of common fail@@ mistakes .
but at the same time they had clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
in your idea : time frame and prob@@ ability to really call something into life ?
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and so for me , that was an amazing thing .
he was another little little kid , he was not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
they come from ideas that are prop@@ el@@ driven by per@@ belief in our he@@ arts .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions have in histor@@ ical context .
but even me in my back species sometimes made this thing sometimes .
and these two worl@@ ds are sla@@ bling together , new thinking and old thinking .
tradition@@ ally , we think in environmental discussion , we &apos;re too too much in the world .
here &apos;s this lo@@ gic in this , yes , in this de@@ ception talk .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new opportunities for leaders .
it &apos;s incredible . you you look around and you see &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
now i just go to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just you . . do you go . &quot;
and now our fa@@ ol@@ ted mind sen@@ cts immediately , and you can do something that .
but it &apos;s always the approach , that it should be be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
it &apos;s something that is not from material , material nature .
where the language was sig@@ ned by sub@@ or@@ dered ran@@ g .
what about me ? ? what about the prin@@ ter st@@ yp@@ e ?
it sta@@ ed itself blue because of the genes that we ad@@ in .
you study the work that he com@@ posed before and after .
i wonder wonder that you often forget something quite element@@ ary .
it &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution to un@@ ck up in@@ pu@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
this is a highly un@@ useful categ@@ ory record .
one project that i started recently was to build a gen@@ e-@@ gun .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work work , not econom@@ ically .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear field ; mod@@ ul@@ ular , liquid .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved saved her .
when i start with the simple , i learn how how i choose .
there are still in the ama@@ zon zone there are still six sh@@ under@@ t billion trees .
they were growing meat she@@ attle on what were basically we@@ t@@ lands lands .
i &apos;ll just showing the top 500 500 of the popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ les .
so i can take a step back and jump directly to a specific se@@ ction .
no fear , no source , child paraly@@ sis , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for sight is quite a pretty complicated process .
if you think that you look good in something , , it &apos;s almost like that .
now all of our objects , our environment , are starting to talk back to us .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ of a car .
but on &quot; citizens connect , &quot; everything is all public public so that anyone can see it .
it was also the beginning of of many dis@@ pu@@ ments in our family .
and she believed that these were the issues we care about .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks that the world is doing worse and worse .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just killed the out@@ si@@ ors with the spe@@ ar .
. you know , i never believed that i &apos;ll eventually working with microsoft .
with your chemical block@@ block , john john -- how about you ?
four times as many in the last 30 years as the previous 75 .
america is in a crisis : economy , national security , the climate crisis .
that means you can see on the internet how how to gain the nutri@@ ents .
and that &apos;s where i brought you a project that i &apos;m going to introdu@@ ce to you .
well , the memor@@ der itself does more than to remember and tell stories .
we can give dri@@ ability a new meaning meaning goes beyond beyond difficult times .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one mentioned anything .
i don not to say say we should take away from the an@@ atom@@ y .
and more than anything else , are you the best parents who they possibly be ?
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty simple in itself .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could record or dis@@ prove .
and often we just ran into a corner end and we had to re@@ ourselves .
but when it comes far it it to be imple@@ mented , something else changes .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive or something .
we told her stories and we sur@@ her that we were still with her .
so , what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
they use their hands to to write appli@@ cations that improve the work of the government .
and that &apos;s what these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
that &apos;s also why , for example , , the perman@@ cy antibio@@ tics to antibio@@ tics .
i had something , your sister had what . go ahead drin@@ drink a be@@ er . &quot;
i talk about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
until in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was lar@@ gely fis@@ hed .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
i find it better if we encoura@@ ge our great creativity to live .
this is the second largest waste waste in our country of america .
because they &apos;ve already swi@@ t@@ ched the cha@@ ir@@ ir@@ ir@@ man twice .
every time , it &apos;s exciting because over and again , i read out something new .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
it &apos;s near the co@@ in of the river called gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
no f@@ ame , no hon@@ or@@ ments , no money . what are you doing ?
that &apos;s me doing the &quot; in life am i bad bad . &quot;
so again , change and adap@@ adap@@ tation are people &apos;s greatest skills .
depen@@ ver@@ cies are for a change in which we haven &apos;t adap@@ adap@@ ted .
as a result , the body is ves more more to the typical typical female course .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day still still there .
imagine that each one can give a a little don@@ ation to it on a screen point .
and someone who has such arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
well , i had a unique place in that day ; i was sitting in 1@@ d .
but it didn &apos;t need them to describe describe the big everyday objects everyday objects around us .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even though it comes to our own best interests .
i looked down through the sho@@ di@@ wall , and i saw them stand on the other side .
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
he said , &quot; what about you ? now drink something . &quot;
bin bin bin laden brings an increas@@ ed risk ke risk .
these people represent several trillion trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mode that have a specific function .
christ@@ ent@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , or whatever .
i want to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , words , thoughts .
you &apos;ve seen cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol , which is a bad experiment .
not the work itself . it continu@@ on to be as dark as as was ever and and ever .
if you look at in histor@@ ical context , you can see what it does .
the united states is one of the two biggest pollu@@ pollution , along with china .
and now i &apos;ll connect the filter with the b@@ ass for some more expression .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of cities , all right .
because steve jobs once said , you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
ne@@ ar@@ ity law , form law of continu@@ ity and so on .
and suddenly have an interface , which is signific@@ antly intui@@ tive and much more natural .
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring our nutri@@ ents .
so the baby is carbon positive for entire life , from from beginning .
so the , so the music works for me the much the spo@@ ken language .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he came on the table with a bright , almost imm@@ m white color .
and if we know knowledge , maybe we can even draw wisdom wisdom from it .
i think we can power this world with the energy that doesn &apos;t destro@@ kill it .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
not like i did -- i develop games games . i &apos;m a little ob@@ ta@@ dent .
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always always for more creativity .
okay , just a quick example of a version of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ min@@ ism what is female . &quot;
you would call this in teams , a re@@ al-@@ time system .
you see in the middle the col@@ olo@@ s@@ se@@ um , the river of ti@@ ber .
as an ic@@ e@@ berg is mel@@ ting , i &apos;m brea@@ thing in its dom@@ t-@@ temporary atmosphere .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
i went close close , and i slowly realized that these kids actually beat something .
so we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ mel@@ ate for our experiment .
you know , the average super@@ cr@@ cr@@ today , off@@ you 4@@ 5,000 products .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ in whose mother would beat her .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through women .
so he did what any good engineer would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
this is a generation that grew up seeing their voice as gran@@ ted .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
we need to find ways to face these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
we te@@ pped down from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ .
and it &apos;s now now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
should i get married later ? should i have children , or make a career ? &quot;
this is the can@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean co@@ coal factory .
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evol@@ ves .
this was then solved by ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
that means all our intelligence means that we want be gri@@ mmer than trees .
on this island , this is the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa island on the a@@ z@@ ors .
and the process is always three of the dies@@ els , two two are always being wa@@ ited .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet not go back , they go forward .
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reason these are .
if you take cap@@ ins , they &apos;re even more effective than tab@@ ills of any form .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
this is the world of the wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the ur@@ fore@@ forest of con@@ go .
and that radi@@ cally trans@@ the interaction that we human beings have with our outside environment .
but is it a hard thing because of the movie , or a hard thing for me ?
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
one million people spend every year leave la@@ tin america and migra@@ ing to the united states .
only for about 12 percent of your decisions , you took an hour or more of your time .
but if i could do that and sur@@ certainly ely it it , i would do it .
and they realized that the city never never rele@@ off this hy@@ hy@@ dr@@ ant .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
essentially , the bottom of the sea came on de@@ ck and then thro@@ wn back .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , huge lot of money .
this this is w@@ la@@ di@@ t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin , from tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
here we see , with fil@@ ce , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ die ...
there &apos;s created no di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , they say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
12 to 24 hours later , everything all bled together the way as it was .
so we have got eyes eyes , and now you think we see from front to wards .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
we tell people , well , you don &apos;t have environmental consciousness in the south .
all right , there &apos;s o at the front , that &apos;s a quick piece .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes out of the healthy and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bis@@ or of wor@@ che@@ ster .
she really like to like him , because he has a tenden@@ cy to sin@@ rec@@ ity .
and the brown is , of , the conven@@ tional system , the green one is our system .
and the obser@@ vation of your team is more important than all l@@ or@@ be@@ ans in the world .
in in spirit of the other , of remem@@ ber@@ , you get a different story .
this is an player standing standing on the edge of something called the epi@@ c vic@@ .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players ma@@ ster@@ y good ? &quot;
there are these ancient cu@@ bes , of she@@ ep cu@@ bes . you know ?
they played rock games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been 16 years war@@ craft .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and we see the world and the people around us .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;ll don@@ it all again .
so despite that war@@ ning , i knew anybody was going to buy the nam@@ m rights .
... that doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er@@ co@@ are are you in ?
i think my personal perspective is very easy expla@@ ined with this slide and your access .
it &apos;s not about what is reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to take decades of decades .
and it does it tly with metho@@ ds , which we don &apos;t really really understand .
and yet , 4@@ percent percent of all killing points don &apos;t end with a re@@ rest .
we &apos;ve also done at the corner of this special issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
you really to make the decision right if it &apos;s for all forever , right ?
in the an@@ 0s , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the drin@@ king water supply for this city .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i kind of wanted closer closer to the matter , like that .
and so what are our values , and what is our pur@@ pos@@ tion , our foundation ?
and you also have to do it and understand it to do and understand it .
so that &apos;s where , , as a rock , , much more likely to shape the behavior than what looks like .
our vo@@ ds to to sing@@ sing , our hands and feet to dan@@ cing .
i allowed me i asked li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them .
and i i want to introdu@@ ce my island project that i try to show you .
i &apos;ve worked in the collective for for 11 years , that was bas@@ roots democra@@ democratic .
what you might ask is : how is this ? why ? what about those ?
but that &apos;s not it &apos;s not about now . and then i open my hand .
if you ask for the fortun@@ ck of self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
these are decisions about whom your grand@@ children or their grand@@ children , to deal with .
i think if you keep people from it , you &apos;ll get them to failure .
well , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
now -- we can just jump p that -- i &apos;m just going to ski@@ p the video ...
they were there there in febru@@ ary , and there was a lot going on last febru@@ ary .
finally , i get programs that can perfectly fix numbers .
and i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grand@@ a . i going to do it . &quot;
when they came in 100 species , dam@@ n , one of them should have been perfect .
and , if that &apos;s true â â and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
and you can explain explain that in a lot better , there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
you bring a new idea in in , and at the time you ans@@ wer@@ it it with a reaction .
actually , , you have have to prove if there &apos;s such thing like will@@ come .
i &apos;d like to take this idea a little bit further with which is a little bit crazy .
because the set was an accu@@ per copy of the building plans plans of the ship .
now if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
doesn &apos;t happen happen at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that would be nice . there would be che@@ che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and now just just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side out so again .
oh , you know . ok . great . so we have some players here .
our ancestors used to never had so hard to fight with the question of when someone was dead .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at is anima@@ tion and music in loo@@ loo@@ .
nobody knew where to the next life@@ saving a@@ ed was find in that moment .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to ra@@ cket users .
these little dro@@ p@@ ks were basically the most primi@@ tive cell form .
down there on the de@@ po@@ nia , but also else in the landscape , right ?
when that &apos;s fre@@ of wrong , the student gets the next hard piece up .
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics on the net .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you &apos;d eat .
we imagine epi@@ c sett@@ tory and we give people the the ability to achieve them .
i represent these children who were sent@@ cted to very sever@@ pun@@ ish@@ ment .
immediately we get a sense of the top@@ mes that are most popular popular on wikipedia .
they talk about , they think what it will look like , they run about power .
that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion image points ? &quot;
they say who has no sou@@ l who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
so the second sentence is , if ause is right , he has no sou@@ l .
if someone takes something that they don &apos;t , they &apos;s not just a the@@ ft .
and indeed , this wrong data coming data from stu@@ x@@ net is already taken before .
and i think some companies will only focus on one strength , rather than both .
just as with &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems to have been come out of no@@ where .
the rest of day , the ev@@ , i had this close feeling in my sto@@ mach .
it would be consci@@ d@@ ous of us put people consci@@ ously and consci@@ and and ge@@ ately . &quot;
they can check them less easily , yes , or or get them down .
man 5 : brand al@@ co@@ hol scre@@ yer .
or what i &apos;m looking today today because what you might have thought .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer questions .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of americans do it every day .
evolution pri@@ le@@ the creatures that adap@@ pt to their environment .
man four : my brand brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was ex@@ si@@ tion@@ ing .
this is just the co@@ ined by pressure and print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
i said , &quot; how percent of your fu@@ t@@ ters is chicken ? &quot;
these are real real patients who are having a pa@@ pain@@ ful proce@@ proce@@ d@@ ure .
but the the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
and i &apos;d be happy if ce@@ g would help make to do happen .
imagine the first piece piece : a man who bur@@ burning his li@@ ve@@ work .
seven million people are dis@@ posed on cur@@ ren@@ cy or with condi@@ condi@@ crimin@@ ement .
so , okay , now now to ha@@ ck biology , you kind of need material .
we &apos;re just play in the cost right now . not not by by ru@@ m .
i &apos;m &apos;t trying to be right ; i choose to be happy .
we &apos;re &apos;re here pri@@ mar@@ ily to the limit@@ limit@@ s of biological reality , and to the those of our imagination .
last month , researchers repor@@ ed that the entire continent is now having a negative ice foot@@ print .
fro@@ sty the carbon man is a fun , happy guy .
so it doesn &apos;t have the the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically a of achie@@ able .
why do we stop from people people get knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
no important inter@@ prise that dem@@ red innovation , has ever been add@@ ted without risk .
it &apos;s what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also thre@@ ces the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
the other place that was very interested in urban building is sing@@ apo@@ re .
we &apos;re close to the seas@@ on@@ end and we move to the world cham@@ on@@ ship .
i had better . all this this choice allowed me to have it better .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can see it with the light microscop@@ e .
that &apos;s i think , they are there there are fewer people in there than they actually exist .
and with a kind of flas@@ h@@ light , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is an es@@ el that made made entirely ure nature .
in terms to na@@ na@@ than@@ iel , the music brought brought him back back into a community of friends .
that &apos;s hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good follo@@ p for marketing . &quot;
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come an oil shor@@ city .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of resi@@ ement of humanity .
i could see it in her eyes , there was sc@@ ared , and life was to end .
so i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ p@@ stage are you in at now ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
in the united states , the medical institute institute affected the number at 100,000 .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as a leader of the pan@@ ie lam@@ a .
this is a project called named photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts together two different technologies .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i from microsoft research was done a very good collaboration .
think of this as the sequ@@ of of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ er &apos;s work on virtual earth .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and what they then did .
these wir@@ wir@@ es gener@@ de 13@@ thousand thousand traffic lights when the machine is running on high performance .
the next generation of graphic user interface faces are a much more with behavior .
negoti@@ ate to inv@@ e@@ stors , i looked new social inv@@ e@@ stors .
he looked at me like i &apos;d just quot@@ quot@@ a song of the whit@@ ney hou@@ ston .
so we also did that , and then then , for a while , a competition competition .
con@@ tur@@ tors recognize these kind of collaboration as the core of an i@@ ter@@ ative process .
they have no right to their own facts . &apos; sorry , you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in the world .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s because what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding unding fa@@ thers .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ples center ...
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where outside sing was ban@@ ned .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , have you put this crazy crazy sign@@ ment ? &quot;
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of colli@@ de every 8@@ 8 minutes onto the earth &apos;s surface .
and you know the dri@@ ers of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
con@@ te building blocks became very quickly the ma@@ -@@ used construction unit in the world .
he makes a stat@@ ement about living now , and maybe also about about doing things slowly .
these organisms can be completely dry dry , they can even in the vac@@ u@@ um .
there are an@@ on fun@@ ctions , where i know know exactly where do i have to reach .
in israel , they say , if you save a life of humanity , you going to save the earth .
so , they don &apos;t want to use for the food , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
mu@@ st-@@ run simply means the power station goes to hold the frequ@@ ency .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; &quot; but our water has no in@@ pu@@ an@@ ty . &quot;
so , what we see here is a typical ster@@ dying diagra@@ m is placed up by age .
and that probably worked very well well to the science fi@@ ction role .
a big machine , a cool , ted@@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 0,000 , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
if you take them , you return the diseases come back , terrible path@@ orders , and that &apos;s what right now .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
so we have to look beyond pat@@ ology and focus on all field of human possibilities .
under@@ pants for exactly a week is all i did in my su@@ it@@ case .
and if you think that they don &apos;t look in something , you &apos;re probably be right .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they would win the race .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
i love this picture because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
are they something a little quie@@ t , reser@@ ter , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
so we created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little tox@@ in bottle .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took took a few hundred million years .
he said , &quot; grand@@ a tells the grand@@ children they &apos;re special . &quot;
but now to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of over@@ plus .
it may seem you strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te st@@ cks .
you can put a switch switch between between , and they &apos;ve created a little sli@@ mmer .
the interesting one is the metaphor which defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the nature .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
then , of course , there &apos;s all whole amount of co2 of this material land@@ ing in the atmosphere .
spa@@ tial thinking is clo@@ sely connected to how we understand most of our environment .
the work of interpre@@ ter starts similar like a theater director .
and i said , it takes about about as long as for spo@@ ken language .
there i say , but but sur@@ sure you can can say if you like it or not .
people always always asking me , what do you actually doing in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ ard ?
it taste swe@@ et and p@@ as like taking a bi@@ te from the ocean .
and i &apos;m flying with a little little robot stuff through the ge@@ ge@@ of of the ship .
now i &apos;m just teaching it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
if you want to support 100 100 percent it , you need an incredible wonder battery .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us because this is a bigger thing than that .
we talk ir@@ ir@@ onic , with little leaders , &quot; progress . &quot;
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but almost never the same .
these emotions we never have when we play games , in games just just don &apos;t .
in this time , there were maybe 20 or 25 different types of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
and so the te@@ stes des , in the tal stage , rele@@ ase te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
on the left -@@ hand , you see the ima@@ points , the different percei@@ ded impres@@ sions .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it makes &apos;t matter .
this is a graph of your brain . your brain can be cut into two parts .
or even build du@@ c@@ zens of these cities or hundreds of all around the world ?
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ hy@@ dr@@ ant .
so you have to ti@@ p the i@@ pad and get the fire@@ flies out .
there &apos;s a wide variety of possibilities in the magic to connect the world and technology to each other .
they say , &quot; no , tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
he kept over again through the window , and he could hear all whole to@@ hu@@ w@@ abo@@ h@@ u .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a dur@@ able rock .
one effect , , parado@@ x@@ ical way , is that it paraly@@ zes rather than to liber@@ free .
we &apos;re grow from six and a half to nine billion in the next 40 years .
and you can &apos;t name that , , that would , again , is a little poli@@ tically cor@@ cor@@ rect .
and because you burn that 99 percent , cost profi@@ le is much better .
you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ challenge ?
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on on .
so let me introdu@@ ce you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human load load car@@ rier .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals for attac@@ ks is not in the middle east .
a school uni@@ form up to the butt@@ ons , because it had to be six years six years .
rec@@ ession ession . still still . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and i sent him on .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response , an anti@@ bodies that attac@@ attack a human .
90 percent of our fan@@ started were spon@@ , other animals that are connected to the ground .
over time , we &apos;re focused on the big animals , and in the sea these are the big fish .
when each of you were born in this room , there were 6@@ ,000 languages on earth .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house from di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
so , we don &apos;t need be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be climate positive .
and my love for the ocean hol@@ ops with the same inten@@ sity as ever and ever .
now his new wish now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t have the research talked anymore ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry if you get ak@@ use , look look away , don &apos;t look there .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side kid@@ l hyper@@ hyper@@ d@@ der .
and when you do that , you eventually get a cyber@@ weapons mass mass destruction .
thank you for ch@@ asing us for cure . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
in summer 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ under a tremendous negoti@@ sion crisis .
then she said , &quot; you have to tell me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
and to my de@@ pos@@ ement , i not not only written him , i also sent him to the court .
and instead of economic gri@@ still , i see one of the largest economic sh@@ ots in the history .
the family who was afraid of his life took him all the weapons and all the tools .
so appar@@ ently he doesn &apos;t want to think , but make it propor@@ tion@@ ately simple .
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six com@@ ma three kil@@ ogra@@ ms in her lifetime .
and you really must to quite tough about it , but i think it &apos;s happening .
no , not because i &apos;m a sel@@ just enjo@@ yer and a good person .
so what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may get some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
we dou@@ bt from a common ance@@ to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
a sort of esti@@ ma@@ ted friend@@ dness : somebody had even brought her a couple of shoes .
so so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put online .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamic dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
this fact is often put put in a relationship to the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
at that point , i was sent to the car@@ di@@ ology layer at car@@ di@@ ology service .
do you was@@ h butt@@ ons or pi@@ ck@@ connection ? stone or ac@@ id ?
so you don don &apos;t have to look to classi@@ cal music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next movie , much on .
i think here at the ted group , there are many who are enga@@ ged there .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for environment , or because we should .
and so -- it says , &quot; this box is ... &quot; i write my name .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
she hit me so hard that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then let let me .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ sex@@ y .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hu@@ ged me .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve em@@ ph@@ ded that aspe@@ ct aspe@@ ct in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
secre@@ tly , i was actually wanted to go down to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
in this case , we have to be full gas and get a mira@@ cle in very short time .
what we &apos;re trying at national geographic ultimately is we believe that politicians can never do anything .
but , when it comes writing i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently and i ask myself , why ?
so , we tend like it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a sou@@ l .
there are technical concep@@ ts like such as aug@@ mented reality , called aug@@ mented reality .
although i &apos;m in the fire@@ department , i &apos;m more interested in py@@ ro@@ tic things .
it &apos;s not possible that everything evol@@ ves forever and forever as fast as we now .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of the hl@@ one industry around christ@@ mas was this .
what is a story story characteri@@ des re@@ through@@ tions , meaning@@ ful moments and and ends .
early the after@@ noon noon , people here and there who are phone calls and are moving .
so we &apos;re supposed to view them as something that is necessarily be present to present for our lives .
there are enzy@@ mes called called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that that actually di@@ gest dna .
yes , children are in@@ her@@ ently curious curious or should should be curious curious , designers too .
or c , because you &apos;ve agre@@ ined to them that they &apos;re un@@ sub@@ tive .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people people gain know@@ knowledge of it .
you can only , of course only if you in some way being man@@ managed here .
it &apos;s a physical painting in london , but it covered with ima@@ points .
a story a dealing with new opportunities like the environmental crisis .
we &apos;ve tried multiple approach@@ to simpli@@ fy it to the mini@@ mal components .
it conver@@ ts co2 in me@@ than@@ e using hydro@@ gen as an energy source .
it &apos;s in sh@@ and and and ance in america , and it helps our economy grow .
he &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and lo@@ ving , and workers re@@ main in wa@@ ge and bread .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
well , they were also highly tech , and they fac@@ for exten@@ e planning .
it means to produce something that is in one , to ti@@ ck@@ out the potential .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing about creating things that are used and inter@@ acting with the people .
and i started playing around , and realized that something was happening .
they tend to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices you offer in a decision .
but when something like this like happens , it changes the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative conditions .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange exchange your dna .
we can get them to do things they thought they they couldn &apos;t .
in an emergen@@ cy layer , i &apos;ve over@@ ved a blin@@ dness set twice .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on a free@@ foot , and there &apos;s not place place is place .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries tried to contact and made a very profound mistake .
their own photos are sig@@ ked with meta@@ data data that a another person has mit@@ in .
finally , the positive alternative mix@@ es to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
the fourth point is that history for for us is a place of information development .
and we think we would prote@@ cting the environment if we &apos;re a little less dama@@ ful .
it certainly makes sense to be less dama@@ ful about oil use .
at every place where you throw away , from , yes , you &apos;re creating opportunities for life .
but it &apos;s very strange to la@@ y@@ ia about what we musi@@ cians are doing with our music language .
this woman finally com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it would wouldn &apos;t see her much .
it &apos;s something between this and we think it changes the way information can be used .
sounds crazy . but it re@@ back back that your own imagination can create a reality .
and this really starts with a fundamental response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts right immediately .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
it &apos;s 75 percent of the energy consumption -- leading up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud cloud of image points .
because when the wine is there and the person &apos;s there , i open it .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut it .
for , for here , a study that we &apos;ve done in a magazine process .
well , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 got it , lots of blogs started writing about it .
i tend to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
it &apos;s getting faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s the reason why it seems so so so using .
and if we have an energy plus , we &apos;ll also have water in over@@ plus .
and so we started with the question : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
so not more zer@@ os and ones ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic code , but just just a metaphor .
well , with se@@ vent@@ h , you just have dreams , but not any major memor@@ ies .
but even if you replace these kinds of sound , it rema@@ rema@@ just just little technical .
i made all of these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films , for a very small audience .
a year year or so ago , i read a study that was really really up@@ my off .
i calcul@@ ated that the time it takes at 21 billion hours playing time a week .
here are the four things i found : first , ur@@ gen@@ ability optimis@@ m .
the reason for that that it requires a lot of trust to to play a game with someone .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real time control systems begin to appear in our lives .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart of this code .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to be be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed with possibilities that might be sc@@ ared them .
and what do you want to see van van go@@ gh created this ma@@ ster@@ piece piece ?
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th , it was appro@@ appro@@ ved second time at 1@@ 14 to a voice .
they already have a building site , and you already mentioned this area for the second city .
and if their employees can &apos;t &apos;t tell them apart , nei@@ &apos;t their custom@@ ers either . &quot;
on mid@@ night , the mon@@ k came up and he said he had to close the sar@@ in .
we know very exactly where all the at@@ machines are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ h .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
you can make your opini@@ on , on every chan@@ nel at at given time , and they do it .
what what happened happened is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
then the next steps steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
but one of them may , with lucky , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i think all of here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
and we had the conclu@@ sion that magic magic and magic were re@@ placed by machines .
green is free , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is input , and orange is wir@@ able .
and they say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
so i want to say , there were a few choices , but not all of that was a question of the choice .
i think that success success pressure has taken our artists over the last 500 years .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change a serious threat to our business .
but that also brings me back to the point , when do things things more intui@@ tive ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you also want to have ni@@ x with it .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ ability , which is prop@@ he@@ t .
so in the last years , we &apos;ve started to about the happiness of the two species of self .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
and he called this part of his course x factor , the potential of the human will .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ red , it &apos;s very comfortable .
so here here &apos;s a young female and a males in a pur@@ su@@ tracking game .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that the beginning of the talk was been killed .
and if we showed that to people , we can make a behavior change .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we are a brand a challen@@ ging .
one of of things , as you know , has been ligh@@ ved already , there are lots of r@@ r@@ ters .
we set a a little cooking operation right right at the business of business .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to force ourselves to environment by using it ...
we pick some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we them work with city admini@@ stration .
if it really , that means that we &apos;re here in the middle of a transition .
the first steps in the story i &apos;ve told you , took me a billion years a piece .
and it &apos;s with a way to re@@ bine ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ re@@ production . &quot;
we know that a process process process is not opti@@ mal when it gets too complicated .
you can go to the website , load all design fore@@ models and make it yourself .
and then you &apos;d suddenly suddenly out what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
all you have to say is &quot; trained words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
extremely important is , now it &apos;s extremely important , and and much , much going to even more important in the future .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different da@@ of time , lots different light .
that leads to star@@ vation . it leads to certain@@ curity . it leads to dis@@ rest .
that inclu@@ des everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
instead of breaking tting your head a head , they just burn it up . a great thing .
and it would be the best if people do it , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
you find crazy crazy examples from all the world , how people optimi@@ ze the system and re@@ f@@ the system .
i don &apos;t want to the past , and not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
so i &apos;ll show you you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
and even when we think of the future , we don &apos;t think about our future don usually think as an experience .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life &apos;s life themselves ?
now , let me tell you what happened one night when when the sensor@@ s stopped stopped working .
there &apos;s the gra@@ y box down there , and on top there , you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
so when i travel@@ ed to go to these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot to learn .
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we ended in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
this is the work very smart people at the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
i think we must do something against a alter@@ changing piece of medical culture .
and over a period of and a half to two hours , she began to feel better .
the second story is to show another concept , the transforma@@ able range of of ill@@ on .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
and now i &apos;ll connect the fil@@ filter with the head@@ stuff so i drive the effect live live .
that means , our whole intelligence means that we want to be gri@@ ham@@ than trees as trees , right ?
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , how to get a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
do we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you you can solve the technical problem .
well , last year on this site site were 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
so i shif@@ ted that , and i made this other film about the great ship sel &apos;s going going .
i asked the top scientists several , &quot; do we really get down to near zero ?
when countries meet in places like cop@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn not just talk about co2 .
and those of you that are interested can can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
this &apos;s one of the explan@@ ations that is given for domin@@ ance of the memory itself .
we set a proje@@ ctor , against a wall of the par@@ king lots outside the hospital .
so for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power plant , or work in a car factory .
and my view , the mo@@ s@@ sad involved , but the driving force is not israel .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city provi@@ off@@ ers people new opportunities .
and this problem you often often when you look at the long li@@ sts of all this fund .
and when he saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , or beautiful buildings .
and that leads ds to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
have you ever repe@@ up a second or or third , as they say right now ?
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once once portra@@ it a woman .
i had imag@@ of a journey of the penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;m ever going to be .
according to the great possible break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest thing you know ?
but is there a third possibility , a comp@@ ting , fascinating terri@@ fying opportunity ?
now the first project i want to share ce you actually actually one of the first ones in our lab .
my life is really extremely bl@@ essed by the working on some amazing projects .
you can have me as a farmer , you can have in le@@ ther , but no one has ever ele@@ sen cted a farmers .
she was saving my life by let me use the toi@@ let in the teacher classroom .
in another chap@@ ter , you have photograph photograph a piece of mr@@ i and tag tag .
as a young law@@ yer , i had the great privi@@ lege to meet meet ink par@@ ks .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re telling me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
these fe@@ ks were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional professional and they were fantastic .
that &apos;s six and 20 countries who are control four@@ ty percent of the oil supp@@ lies .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ fl@@ amin@@ gos shouldn &apos;t even even there in the the place .
and none of these stories is very cul@@ turing or great -- but one of them is is clearly this ...
and i met with his father and brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what does it mean for a object to vi@@ te te at the same time and not to vi@@ bra@@ te ?
and after that , we looked in which case people people tend to buy a glass mar@@ mel@@ ade .
so what i do is i sc@@ change the order where the decisions appear .
i &apos;m not not about the details of the slide , but about the general form .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to ear@@ gain their attention .
she said , &quot; the first promise promise you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
every second every day , our senses are cat@@ up much more information than our brain can ever process@@ ed .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a od@@ d problem of modern , rich , western societies .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
in short , a silicon able is an inter@@ active computer at the size of a coo@@ k@@ le .
that made made it a lot more more friend@@ able , but it &apos;s also doing much better , of course .
we could only gli@@ as am@@ or@@ p@@ ous m@@ oll@@ ands across through the of the world .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the same system when the same price goes five percent per year .
there don &apos;t normally a de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date le .
think about that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
it was all then the k@@ f@@ a , and the je@@ wish was was name named k@@ f@@ a .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it has no protein , and scientists are all this stuff right it .
please look at the shape of the ic@@ berg and where it &apos;s at the water line .
so i want to talk about what what could be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
she came from from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was talking about a student .
well , there are all sorts of play@@ y solutions like this , but they all not very much .
he wanted to capture the the feelings playing , so he built a camera in front of the players .
so , what are we want to mani@@ fest fy -- a ab@@ led man or or a powerful person ?
he has nothing to do specifically specifically cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , ur@@ ri@@ i@@ ment .
as a doctor you can do good . as a care@@ doctor , but you can do more .
what i have to tell myself myself when i get crazy about this is : don don &apos;t afraid .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts , an opini@@ on , or by by your audience .
be it that we know flo@@ late glob@@ ally and acc@@ up faster and better and better .
i said , one of the greatest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- made his beginning to youtube .
still , we &apos;re very ar@@ re@@ sted as information process@@ ation , very , very ar@@ re@@ sted .
cer@@ ti@@ fication fication ha@@ cking and out fa@@ ke cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
because he led led to a fi@@ ad where he doesn &apos;t stop himself .
that means , we &apos;ve looking for the first time to find the largest largest battery in the world .
look at it carefully , this is the today , clean , coal technology .
put it in a sou@@ p kitchen , clean up a park in the neighborhood .
you have them , you &apos;ve them them to food , not to nutri@@ ent the@@ ft .
the sum@@ sum@@ mary inclu@@ tains a short over@@ view and a symbol of the area from which it comes from .
this super@@ computer is called global mortality -- sensi@@ sensi@@ tivity system , of course .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail .
we want to establi@@ sh life life sentence without un@@ condi@@ tional pun@@ ment for children .
so when i went looking for career job as a adult , it was the film@@ making .
and it makes me excited about in terms of consi@@ der@@ ing democracy .
they say that all things that are shown up there are follow a life cycle .
so we met in dec@@ ember in the house of a hotel hotel in mi@@ ami .
so to achieve a reali@@ out@@ come , it , from from me me , it goes out to planning .
that &apos;s where you usually come out when you call in your your call in 3@@ 11 .
when did the last time you heard of somebody who talked about mis@@ failure about about men@@ ke about about failure ?
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions actions are completely natural .
the nur@@ se who gave that bra@@ act , was brought to a education camp .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under its feet to qua@@ b .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried it .
this au@@ ro@@ ction all around the world leads leads a dra@@ matic incre@@ ction in fir@@ es .
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s be a lab .
that means we lose losing in the ground about five thousand times more than re-@@ educ@@ formed .
in my school , i was driving the bus to school every day an hour hour per distance .
so there are deep profound lessons for us about the nature of drive and success .
we become as good at whatever to , as the most important people in the world .
the the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you &apos;re seeing here , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and hand ap@@ p called &quot; citizens connect .
now , why do we draw gra@@ s in the technology on se@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
i think the reason is that that we realize something something is going on .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , mess@@ cent and used idea in my head .
this is a photograph i took last apri@@ l in the north west of the ama@@ zon .
this is a reali@@ stic case . this is a copy from the guar@@ di@@ an .
and what it does is it causes people to walk into business business and ask that question .
a second circle already begins to cor@@ ate or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
at a lie , you see the li@@ ar doesn &apos;t &apos;t believe what he says .
it was always about trying trying to understand the world and push the boundar@@ ies of the possible .
and that &apos;s that b@@ w@@ l students were been trained to figure out a right plan , ok !
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , that ru@@ ined the whole experience .
beyond the cities , all of these percei@@ tion and driving dra@@ in into objects of everyday life .
and this is what what got us to think about the following project that i &apos;m showing showing you now .
and then he said three words -- the most ti@@ ti@@ less words i &apos;ve ever heard .
i think the gen@@ us us , the style i have is &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
this ch@@ art shows what it first looked when the video first first popular last popular last summer .
because i &apos;ve experienced it , when i was a la@@ go@@ go@@ go@@ on in west africa in west africa .
it &apos;s a means with which the sou@@ l of a particular culture has access to the material world .
if i asked asked to to count the big world religi@@ ons , what would you say ?
with so many op@@ tions you can choose , people find very hard to even decide .
with 100 different types of je@@ ans in the window , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for mistakes .
and our approach just was to say , well , you don &apos;t have to do that .
and i would invi@@ invi@@ te everybody to deal with it and even try something yourself .
and also from bee@@ tho@@ ven you know that he was hearing more than he had already a dea@@ f .
then they just consu@@ only what &apos;s on the sun and the wind there , where they live .
we took taking little robots that we had built , we wra@@ up a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
well , we rele@@ ct a lot of carbon every year , over 26 billion tons .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ suffering ? &quot;
now this is a direct conflict between the living itself and the memory itself .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient suff@@ suffering , but a little bit and much less than before .
people are about recogni@@ zing that they should think of happiness when they think of politics .
when i first saw her , i i took her from her mother &apos;s gut . &quot;
they call this there &quot; stre@@ aming trials , &quot; in the u.s. , we call this as &quot; tracking . &quot;
women , like men , have in our bodies have what &apos;s called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ as .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone does in the dis@@ hes .
two pair of bri@@ ff@@ es for the school , each to to cover the holes in the other other .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government get in crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
because the transition seems to be very very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you inside your inside .
he got in@@ tra@@ si@@ ous anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and re@@ covered a few days later .
i think that this can be changed by creating re@@ combin@@ ed vac@@ cin@@ es in the process .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that you know what , the de@@ vil with it .
in california was seen a 40 percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ now now of the si@@ er@@ ra .
and the si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital ti@@ zed data .
but su@@ c@@ essi@@ ve , i just pulled this scri@@ pt as a primary medium , gave to in in .
but what i would re@@ gre@@ t is because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ department , i &apos;m &apos;m interested in the py@@ ro@@ cal things .
well , in efficiency , e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
in the united states , what &apos;re strug@@ trying to measure the experience of happiness of the population .
and i turned around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
in a fra@@ of a second i lost every feeling and every movement below my my bed .
more than anything everything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
&apos; vi@@ val re@@ vi@@ val me@@ on sk@@ at@@ at@@ al k , except on the fri@@ day .
just tell me a little bit how that is connected to your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
in 2007 2007 , i decided that we should concep@@ concep@@ alize how we think about economic development .
and they found that an average ce@@ o is working around 9 week with 13@@ 9 week .
and one of the things that we did , i &apos;d like to share with you through just a short video .
i think the big picture makes makes sense if you divi@@ it into a few billions billion steps .
when i was a little girl my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ key@@ watch .
and because it is , there &apos;s a basic human ni@@ ty that the law must respect .
that as humans as humans are not completely developed as long we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
and the old ada@@ , &quot; when it flo@@ ds , demand demand &quot; is very true .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ . in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
and he knew her , he would have been able to extra information to her .
and i got a bad sun@@ sun@@ fire , and i was convinced , that i wasn &apos;t really going to come come from there .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ som@@ es a day .
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone today today : is this idea completely okay for you ?
on the other end of the planet , the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice ice mass on the planet .
i question , , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
so , com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ rely on us of interpre@@ ts who re-@@ rein@@ vent the pieces .
capital , chemistry and machines machines are standing in it , and it never produced something really good for food .
so let &apos;s look at factor factor a second , and think about how we can get that to zero .
do we have to provide emergen@@ cy to to try and keep the earth temperature stable ?
and that , although none of them are any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- -- &apos;s just just sugar p@@ ills .
and i noticed a few things that epi@@ c sett@@ ins in online worl@@ ds so possible .
so scientists recently came to believe that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy crazy story is true .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria just as they &apos;re important for their life .
first a ball game in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ art -- and i don &apos;t think of foot@@ ball .
i feel like as we move forward to to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
so what is it for an idea to think about building in hon@@ dur@@ as build an whole new city ?
even in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single day of a week .
i think it &apos;s very challen@@ bling us of us to say that we are the final product of evolution .
a politics from fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our vehicle dete@@ ctor .
because sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ stent , and technology is a resource liber@@ ating force .
we ada@@ just our standards to the new level , and don &apos;t re@@ mind of what was there .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks , and b has the benefits benefits and risks .
and that &apos;s because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less care@@ ful .
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the the wrong sal@@ at@@ res@@ sing .
you &apos;re never been very surprised , because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are home@@ high .
that means , this first impres@@ sion is happening in a rapi@@ dly fast speed of how we percei@@ ve things .
and that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that tri@@ spar@@ ples the idea of people here ?
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both together in the notion of happiness .
and the a students are ti@@ hard exam@@ exam@@ hard , get the better teachers and etc .
let &apos;s start start at the reality that people , , in some cultures today make decisions about their pro@@ gen@@ spring .
in good and and in evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions will be to us .
and so the film will explore this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? forever , , forever ?
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
and over the course of next eight eight or nine days , they went to the scen@@ cks .
in the 197@@ 0s -- rather in the early early &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe spon@@ ed lots of development projects .
what &apos;s interesting is is that at that time the human was also ously a media produ@@ cer and medium itself .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about story@@ telling .
every own music is being up when you &apos;re constantly com@@ posed out with music .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re hot in this place . something &apos;s wrong .
and the reality of that expression reach@@ es all of us , and moves , inspi@@ inspired and uni@@ united .
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to achieve , and then we talk about the inter@@ medi@@ step .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s much stron@@ ger than a white ball .
so many people we have have in the world now , who spend at least an hour a day with online games .
we work with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa and invi@@ te them learn social social re@@ design .
it could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; it pac@@ ps it with eg@@ gs . &quot;
we start , for example , to the fact that we have at least least 95 percent of our dna common with ch@@ im@@ es .
one of the most important things that that we have to think it is that government is not the same thing as politics .
how many of you seen the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m super@@ computer wat@@ son at &quot; risk ? &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you sna@@ ck , lie lying easy or long ?
but also , we &apos;re currently working on using the same approach@@ es for developing vac@@ cin@@ es .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ ables , it &apos;s like an au@@ ou@@ th system .
and i thought , &quot; wow wow , that &apos;s have to be involved into film art . &quot;
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a proje@@ ctor .
and dr. p@@ . always e very very color@@ ful flies and was for work with kids just like kids .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again again with the idea of percei@@ ve and increase our environment .
the matters is the creativity that is in the internet culture of tech@@ ies and ge@@ e@@ ks .
and then when you make good foot@@ ots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
all these photos are lin@@ ked together , and there creates something that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
and in the next decade we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in whatever .
the real meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
i even come to one of my favor@@ , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
i didn &apos;t liked my intuition , and perhaps just because i don &apos;t play particles so often .
she was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped a world of the world .
in fact , we thought there &apos;s the end here , but we &apos;ve been trying to bring the process a little bit further .
and when this happened , people knew what this was . they called it on his name .
and that &apos;s always for us humans is a more intui@@ tive , if i have to think think about a little bit about it .
it &apos;s become the largest today and one of the most private bird reser@@ ves all across europe .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out out and read your school tas@@ ks under the street light .
and that &apos;s happened because i experienced something with my legs and not despite those experiences .
i &apos;ve working with people with war@@ f adults -- so , people who were smaller than usual usual .
and listen , everybody has a right to think , a right to their opini@@ of progress .
but we know , when we address that , , the social ti@@ tions are very sensitive lic@@ rup@@ bed .
virtu@@ ality suddenly became alien stran@@ alien to us , and it has nothing nothing to do with reality .
well , unfortunately , we we see this face in real life , when we face difficult problems .
you &apos;ve got to go up , on the fire by , and you &apos;ve got to get this pair of of shoes . &quot;
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ ers then , and what you might now mean for him today .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts electric power on the same are being built in the world .
climate change cri@@ tics : do you have one or two ences for you to maybe convince you ?
and the child plays , after a memor@@ break , rather before a red now plays a blue flo@@ wer .
within a year , you imple@@ a a survey survey , and then you start with the commercial fis@@ catch .
i learned him from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic the p@@ path fin@@ der in the 197@@ 0s .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say is flying fly .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can can just farm it .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the a@@ cultural industrial model for the future .
this is the planet we live on on don &apos;t pre@@ tend it &apos;s not .
is this something that you can let us te in , because you now have a few minutes left ?
but at the time when mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular organisms arrived , things began to change .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chap@@ ter in terms of mo@@ bility .
we need digital security systems there where a human machine oper@@ ator can &apos;t re@@ act fast enough .
and i believe that our current en@@ pun@@ ish@@ ment ment philosoph@@ y y doesn &apos;t help anybody .
four : bad car@@ rot . speak@@ er five : dangerous cru@@ ise ships .
i said , &quot; no , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
no , not , because we &apos;re producing enough cal@@ ories already to feed the world than fe@@ feed the world .
or better , how can we create conditions en@@ power each community to feed themselves ?
but at the end , it point that i took space space scientists with us to the deep sea .
and the fundamental lesson , i think is con@@ struc@@ ism is actually a commit@@ atory sport .
there will be this little little blood pressure re@@ ing device that you atta@@ onto an iphone iphone iphone or something .
and they developed special structures , which did nothing else but than process@@ ing information within the organis@@ m .
it allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than the the normal techniques would allow .
over the last three decades , crimin@@ al rate in america has dec@@ ed tremend@@ matically .
here , i think , the art and the movie can fill fill the gap , and as simu@@ lations .
but now there &apos;s a b@@ ve , new solution to get us out of this mis@@ circum@@ situation .
you need these lie to be a lie to life , to main@@ susta@@ tain self-@@ del@@ de@@ ception .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
don &apos;t wait wait making a difference in someone &apos;s life until you got your first million million .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stu@@ dest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
now look at what happened on that day just obser@@ ving the activity happens in the network .
are you an up@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ te ? are you something that &apos;s putting your blood in wo@@ ons ?
as an example , the most sophisti@@ tle version we know this type of communication is human language .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ explo@@ ded cur@@ ve .
i spend most of my my time working with people in trial , pris@@ ons or death cells .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and you made a noise noise machine .
and that &apos;s an idea that , when you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
whether he &apos;s a lo@@ place of a mind or a bunch of property , is ir@@ relevant .
and you can &apos;t understand ti@@ bet@@ &apos;s &apos;s suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it the ground level .
and one reason is that this huge amount of heat is is war@@ ing green@@ land from the north .
you &apos;ll never forget forget anymore , because i show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tor is .
so , it &apos;s about creating creating a large foot@@ print that will becoming a we@@ t@@ lands .
on the day before the event , i called the ce@@ head of the public work for the company .
instead of pus@@ hing water out they used the chan@@ n@@ els to then dra@@ bring water water in .
so three very difficult problems that might be solu@@ ble and therefore you need to work on .
he had understood that the medical diagno@@ sis and how someone deal with it are two different things .
fri@@ day : a universal truth truth -- five words : golden par@@ il@@ tes fit to everything .
now this may sounds ab@@ sur@@ d to you , as though you &apos;ve never been thinking about new cities .
the categ@@ ories have to tell to the sele@@ ction , not the who provi@@ des the choice .
if you know something about govern@@ ance technology , you know that it doesn &apos;t work that way .
it was about a method that parents can figure out what are the right public schools for their children .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before will join to global communication .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
we want to get things that are gone or things that no longer as they were .
the second largest ad of that we can see today are not driven by driven .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
if they &apos;re surro@@ unded by by way , you also also notice it , and they can a little nervous .
now how about this mit with the virtu@@ ality which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us , in the pig@@ s are over over the missing components of ex@@ cre@@ ents .
they do it because they can follow the te@@ ated white line in the high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
and if you want the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect you have to reach the need@@ le .
so i started thinking thinking what it is to making these games master master .
imagine the screen could just appear appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , in different resol@@ ution .
when you turn the light on , it looks like . so &apos;s the same way we saw it before .
this can be in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
it needs truth and beauty beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this has been mentioned so often today .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is connected to everything .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re so much more than it costs to build them .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that fel@@ lo@@ ws have written in the last year .
and the color of paint and sha@@ sha@@ ings may remember you &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the ocean as we &apos;ve be@@ aten fore@@ sts .
and not only that that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to ra@@ va@@ ough@@ ough@@ of this world .
but these artic@@ were worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and and finally , figured found it .
if paul spea@@ speaking in public hearing tion , he cannot say without ar@@ med guar@@ ri@@ ards .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not dam@@ dam &apos;s specific cul@@ tured meat .
that &apos;s going , i think , in the next next decade or two will be part of the national stic .
you &apos;ve probably heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; pl@@ us-@@ 1 star@@ ch , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
these are our ma@@ ster@@ players . 500 million people who are remark@@ arily good in &quot; something . &quot;
they help with di@@ nutri@@ nutri@@ ents food , and they protect them against certain diseases .
for us and she , play is fundamental for the conne@@ of relationships and and the care of toler@@ ance .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types asking the social nor@@ ms .
now you might think that the whole breaking breaking of categ@@ ories would make someone like me really happy .
and after that , i thought about it , i decided to ban te negative energy from my life .
as we were fall@@ down , i had that feeling , and man , dying is not terri@@ fying .
what would you do that that you sho@@ ot , because you think they &apos;d be there forever ?
woman : if dan a brand were , he would probably be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des cab@@ rio .
this is the first object you can see that was in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
to be part of const@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ appro@@ twice by con@@ gress .
at the end of every day , i coo@@ cooking a giant top sou@@ p that we shared .
that &apos;s because the government is like an ocean , and politics that &apos;s the top in@@ meters .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , us , the humanity , is we &apos;ve gun to abstra@@ ct .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you &apos;ve actually recor@@ ded .
we want to fight pre@@ bi@@ ases and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ justice system .
and this was an example in which our our governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
in a some sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ pole is the heart of our global climate system .
a tv set or was@@ hing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use it .
we just wanted wanted to know , what about a normal , stin@@ in@@ normal electro@@ chemical battery ?
that means , 15 pounds of wild@@ fish is necessary to get a pounds of of t@@ weight tun@@ a .
one is , the energy sity that these technologies generate is dra@@ matically lower than the of power plants .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among including one called es@@ ol@@ ar who has great solar mal technologies .
if you put an ex@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow of dra@@ moved to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wonder of thin@@ ity .
we don &apos;t want to ge people to eat this di@@ dic@@ ated stuff , such as mani@@ sa@@ ok .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family decide .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people equ@@ well , life is not of teeth and cy@@ cla@@ ws alone .
our cities have just , in the last few years , just equi@@ pped with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
when these ima@@ points fall down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text .
no , they didn &apos;t destro@@ yed the building ; it &apos;s just that the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
so for example , number 16@@ 4 is po@@ cking very out of this code you can &apos;t over@@ over it .
i thought , &quot; do you put the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a back interview .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less is more .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order in which repres@@ represents this information .
but what interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in any culture .
this was our first trial to start with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
and i would want to proto@@ co@@ that i &apos;ve been here for my part of the jobs . &quot;
one example from a whole different area . mon@@ et has the the ero@@ chs x times .
and now we can now almost almost day in the daily newspaper is what you find in that third sentence .
and the prepar@@ ation for do this were enormous . we had to build c@@ ameras and head@@ lights and all kinds of things .
we got at a point where we have the same progress as earlier .
it &apos;s absolutely ama@@ ingly ingly cold and sou@@ vent@@ ing even to ourselves who can afford afford .
i really hope that we we play meaning@@ ful games in order to survive a another century on this planet .
or are we wired to become something else -- something that &apos;s even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
and as a part of that , they gave us a concept that negoti@@ ated from an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ality .
just to give you look , i zo@@ om out out to see what you get .
one on the left left is ja@@ zz , and one on the right s@@ wing , but you know what ?
and the next puzz@@ piece is about four women in three generations together together building a new life .
you might think that &apos;s just just a landscape landscape , and the bottom part has been pul@@ ated .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight we &apos;re all fighting for about who allowed to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
well , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something in the way is going happen happen here .
you have to make the sound of the wind , b@@ low it away and read the rest of the book .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and power power it otherwise doesn &apos;t have .
because obviously , an animal that was very often becomes only r@@ rare before it dies .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
something something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as to show show this slide .
it actually took a few years with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
in in china , now a after@@ coo@@ is is still hon@@ ey po@@ ters , if you sense , right ?
you know , there are two countries that are control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ benefits in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ ster@@ players .
players love to become part of a@@ a@@ ing mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary balance .
and the argument here here would be that the els of evolution slowly ste@@ al , but they &apos;re rel@@ k@@ able .
i was the second volunte@@ er at the brand@@ place , so i had quite good opportunity to go in .
and the side de-@@ ne@@ ones are making ro@@ genes , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
how can we keep keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fres@@ fresh .
i felt it felt as our our fan@@ clo@@ cks and c@@ ameras were dre@@ dre@@ aming .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send home home and there probably probably no pri@@ gers in their treatment .
by sha@@ sha@@ king up the p@@ ables and putting them next next side , he can let the characters interact ...
you can simply enough em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze how critical this factor factor can be to the quality of life a human being .
either &quot; fl@@ oral fusion fusion or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
and that &apos;s a great concep@@ tual tual model of the world , long that they &apos;re not partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
the next puzz@@ piece is how a boat in early morning morning comes quie@@ t to la@@ ke .
as as child , i had colle@@ ctions of sti@@ cks , st@@ ones , ti@@ xes and cla@@ ams .
in these arch@@ a@@ ic models , it heard that we have a fundament@@ ally natural ra@@ ti@@ o to virtu@@ ality .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit ob@@ stac@@ , we often feel different .
for her , life had as@@ a task to her : es@@ cape of her family , and a new life in australia .
already today me@@ than@@ e in some flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e po@@ ging itself out of water .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting the evidence load , you experience the magni@@ vel@@ ity of the lie .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centi@@ grade , that they can survive there .
so in order to understand each other , i want like to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son of myster@@ y science theater was a first to twitter twitter a jo@@ ke .
also , despite their log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic trend on the left side , it goes up@@ ward .
on the day day , they made them go -- s. prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and a grandmother .
they are strong under@@ fu@@ ger@@ tions because we don &apos;t see the problem as much as we should .
so probably or l@@ ly a@@ qu@@ ak@@ ul@@ , fishing fishing , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
it sounds very spac@@ y and it sounds like science fi@@ ction , i know .
two 2 fam@@ ine fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . speak@@ three : p@@ ff@@ c. spra@@ y of the police .
and somehow managed to find the time to teach english and and it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
his mother was lo@@ cked , as pun@@ ish@@ ment for -- for crime to be weal@@ thy .
now re@@ productive all the rema@@ bs who have best the numbers .
that i i can t it differently and make it more beautiful doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better mana@@ i@@ able .
we have to prevent people to knowledge knowledge from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
but not , we have europe europe seven percent , and our net is physi@@ cally the european european .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most lo@@ trained children &apos;s writer .
here &apos;s it need to bring what what we understand under political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness , over and and again .
in this country , , , for children children life life sent@@ without without condi@@ tional pun@@ lation .
this is almost limited limited to total security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
and that &apos;s half of all the wa@@ water problems in earth that are caused by tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
well , when i was a ne@@ ul@@ ing at college college , i had my first biology biology course .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes es don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on completely different technology .
here &apos;s some really cool stuff that we discovered -- really really blo@@ cked cked off .
now the idea of this is not just to che@@ list the machine machine ators in the control room .
we want you to tell a story , but we want you to tell our story . &quot;
so we could fit the world very easily with do@@ wers , maybe even hundreds of of new cities .
yes , i fear of privi@@ lege , of e@@ i@@ ty , of conc@@ ction .
but let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century so that can can predict the development .
we now now almost an infin@@ ite range of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
maybe maybe go back to ancient ancient understanding about the relationship between the people and the myster@@ y of creative .
i brought you you an example from the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka@@ ka tri@@ be .
now , we know from that study that you have to reach to the need@@ le if you have to go to the thing .
we know that we do opti@@ ally work as human beings when we do hard , , important work .
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that will allow you to run faster faster and longer ?
so we may sell a sho@@ e and he becomes the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve wor@@ had ...
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
make metho@@ ds that are easy to use , and start with these to hu@@ g patients in the team .
we say , &quot; computers , please please generate generate a hundred million cho@@ sen sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
and this question was profound profound that we decided to investi@@ explore the answer , and we developed si@@ ft@@ ables .
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by by fli@@ cking the p@@ ace in one way or or another .
and so from the interest in this , in this technology , i &apos;ve moved continue to go in .
all of this needs the ability , our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
this &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual of being as a rock ck .
it &apos;s called gest@@ form law , or even gest@@ alt psychology , which which , again , influ@@ ts us in our perception .
a third sentence that immediately appe@@ right immediately with people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what wood wood we &apos;re prote@@ cted from , when we &apos;re really being che@@ sted .
because the lesson that i try to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go go .
so , i &apos;m basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , make it possible .
if someone asked asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , would be like ?
so all the tools are there , and the only thing that shapes us is our imagination .
and like many people , i thought that government government was basically choo@@ sing people into a office .
so when we look the news , we pre@@ fer to to look looking for negative news .
i &apos;m going to focus to a statistics that i hope that most of you have heard before .
in high high school , a fellow student once said that brian gold@@ was going to learn for a blood test .
unfortunately , aren not in in b@@ ach , but maybe you can just help the the gu@@ ts to do do it a little bit .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice scre@@ pac@@ aging , which is a flu@@ id at room temperature .
well , so you see , certainly no one has to be a can@@ di@@ date .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the ance@@ stry of man .
so there &apos;s lots of people come and look at this there , just because you can see what problems problems you get .
they was assu@@ red that they don &apos;t bi@@ te . in fact , they won &apos;t even leave the glass .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great too that you don &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some rain@@ advan@@ tages .
this is basically the de@@ ad@@ line , which has given us the environmental models that we need to address .
do you say that there are negative negative cations that have dealing with the clou@@ ds to do to move things differently ?
our memory tells us stories , which means what to keep from our experiences is a story .
you don &apos;t sit and you turn turn twi@@ . there &apos;s always very ge@@ , something important to do .
and so it &apos;s been been for for 500 years , since his , i have to say , very successful introdu@@ tion .
and that sa@@ dness really really formed itself in a thought thought , which is that i wish i wish one thing .
so for me , photograph@@ y seemed to more more about being in right place at the right time .
in fact , these programs are so much efficient than any program i could ever ever written by hand .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and de@@ pu@@ ing stat@@ es@@ yers and office workers .
this refer@@ end@@ um will pro@@ pose to invest the money in more security security security , and security .
most of the mass ar@@ cer@@ ents in this country was not happened in the class of non@@ violence .
when 27 years later 27 years back , the fish had s@@ as@@ sed to half of its size .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve long mis@@ sed this point where choice impro@@ ces common well-@@ good .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells and then come back and and killing e@@ . col@@ i .
that &apos;s great . the roman@@ s &apos;t really think a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
40 percent of all people in the world get half half their drin@@ king water from this mel@@ ting water .
it matters to the designers , they tend usually have it in in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great form of rock laws .
i remember me remember last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow somehow people liked this .
you can see it &apos;s a kind a colum@@ n is , often as &quot; &quot; pas@@ travel@@ ing wave wave re@@ actor actor . &quot;
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics who who me crazy crazy were not any fan@@ a@@ tics .
nothing wal@@ into my sle@@ sle@@ ev@@ ve or comes out , no tri@@ ck@@ y . and you can study everything .
but in fact , my research at the institute institute for the future , that &apos;s the opposite opposite is the true .
this also represents the entertain@@ ment value of this speech , so i hope you &apos;ve you you it .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if if you could change cells your your proce@@ dan@@ or ?
do we use these decisions to forming a society that is better , that is more successful , that &apos;s friend@@ ly ?
it &apos;s almost physi@@ physi@@ cally impossible , to be poor@@ ly a@@ zed when you &apos;re wearing bright t red pants .
now , mor@@ gan , the name of transpar@@ ency is : what exactly happened happened to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
and , also recently a recent done with ce@@ os in where they obser@@ watching the ce@@ os for a week .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exten@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
because in this context , we &apos;re beginning to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species has sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
and this really reach@@ es these ideas of creating forming these limit@@ ctions to the available available on the screen .
and we managed able to up to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
so we had to create a new method we could put these little pieces together and could fix the er@@ ors .
so , for the music learning process , you need music language at least as long as the spo@@ ken language .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later later when we moved to california .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times more on our energy without changing their lifest@@ yle yle .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news news , because there are some other problems and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
so we have the memor@@ ing itself and the life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ourselves ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
that means we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
i got another another gift , which is to look into the future , and to back back and to live differently .
so we over@@ list our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i ad@@ ore my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , , om@@ a , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
but finally , i decided , god , i have to go in and give you this crazy case .
if i &apos;m going into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
if you break the gold glass glass down , so everything is possible , you &apos;ll lower k of happiness .
when we &apos;re thinking about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
this is a game with words , which is kind of mix of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
because because people often often come , they can &apos;t make it the user friend@@ ly so that anyone can hand@@ e with it .
sounds first it very ban@@ al , but it &apos;s really exciting when you get to to deal with it .
over@@ m : now i kind of inter@@ acting with the object , i can zo@@ om , zo@@ om in .
here we see this again , we see the dies@@ el again , again here the whole , , single ag@@ gre@@ gate .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ ac@@ tor , which seems seem a little bit difficult , but they might say that about us .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
people wra@@ p themselves in their faith , and so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t liber@@ ash them .
now , if i ever opened the fol@@ fol@@ der the 600 pictures in i would have spent another hour .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just just amazing -- except my physi@@ o@@ therapy .
evolution is all about pas@@ cing the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and generation after generation .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i talked talked very lot about the fa@@ thers .
if you surro@@ around with the right people people , not only will you understand it , you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate it .
so to do these things -- you know , minds people of ban that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
they sho@@ ot@@ the decision decision -- push ot them , even if it comes against their own best interest .
so in other words , the future has s@@ hr@@ ed by year by by a year since i &apos;ve been in the world .
and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing an evolutionary process in the machine , which is happening in the micro@@ -@@ second ter main .
and i find it dangerous dangerous . and i don &apos;t see how it &apos;s taken over into the next century .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ v@@ ine embra@@ spirit of creativity &quot; demon@@ s . &quot;
here we see a very basic service , : does it light at home so that you can read the home@@ work ?
in the rich world are are diseases that thre@@ aten millions of us just one generation ago , , not yet yet .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon soon children will die of it , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
because if we could find that , we would have basically un@@ ce@@ ented human potential .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and you &apos;re , &quot; we &apos;re going to oil oil out . &quot;
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then it incre@@ up my strength and my resili@@ ration .
what should we do with the fact fact that we &apos;re diff@@ different from them just through few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
and who knows when the movie comes out there , we might going to look like a hor@@ de vol@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
there &apos;s actually actually , a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the wir@@ eless plan works working .
we &apos;re not going to answer that to me spon@@ tane@@ ously , but it &apos;s going happen , and &apos;s happening happening now at the moment .
certainly , i would never ever achieve an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ hi@@ , and that seemed pretty un@@ likely to me .
that would have have been without the environmental needs , but that makes it so much important .
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success@@ es of the scientific method .
they played a cu@@ be game , and the vic@@ inner were allowed to break up for an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , my view , the original an@@ atom@@ ic activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
and to win win , the device has got to make better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly quali@@ fied physi@@ cians .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted for over 400 billion stone ones -- or 75 st@@ ones for every person on the planet .
and the man &apos;s grand@@ father did &apos;t afraid before the arc@@ tic night or the wa@@ ing stor@@ m .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean po@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ non@@ sense anymore -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
he &apos;s got a piece of paper , he has no pen@@ pen he doesn &apos;t have asse@@ pe recor@@ ds .
we need market ri@@ ces , carbon ta@@ xes , ca@@ p &amp; trade something that creates a price signal .
as peter told us , they not only the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all .
so if you want ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze happiness of the two species of self at the end end &apos;re going to do very different things .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the laun@@ ch .
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , attemp@@ trial and mistakes , which turns out to be wor@@ meaning@@ less .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could make a a , or we could do b .
immediately , you &apos;ll one for which , of course , such predi@@ ctions , , is which you can &apos;t prove .
the human part of this book , way at the end is obviously course what we &apos;re most interested in .
my heart ra@@ st , i was di@@ di@@ to me while i was attemp@@ trying to figure what was was in front of me .
but once and again , very r@@ ely , something special happened , and one of the wri@@ tors actually became tran@@ scen@@ dent .
in open ach , for example , in the house b@@ ash , 20 percent of the amount of waste are now di@@ a@@ ling .
but here it is : if you get the evidence you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
the first example predi@@ cts what many of you know and and some of you value , very few don &apos;t need at all .
so we simply create those words that we &apos;re use using in the language of poli@@ tically cor@@ rect rect speech .
so these they ten@@ ded to survive longer , and they multi@@ p@@ ed at greater scale .
but these concep@@ ts of the cyber@@ -@@ age , they are allo@@ us back back back kinds kinds of opportunities to re-@@ re@@ disco@@ vering our abilities .
his his cause to write the piece becomes becoming and and more to my personal cause to play it .
but there are no clu@@ bs for which to look around where to learn how to make fire .
so i &apos;m in in one of my favorite pictures , ern@@ est workers from pie@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel in the brea@@ met .
i &apos;d like to to you with this mechan@@ ism today or bring close something something you you probably un@@ consci@@ ously familiar with .
and the main lesson that i think think we have learned is that they &apos;re really different .
recently recently i talked to the oil oil industry , and they said that they didn &apos;t form this model .
it &apos;s as much if i would say , sha@@ ck your child , beat three times instead than five times .
and that moment , it was like a film director had been asking a change in the stage .
it turns out that it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your movie . &quot;
and we think we &apos;ll be the first of fuel els the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
and it &apos;s about solving , in a play@@ ful , creative , original way , solving a problem .
what &apos;s the machine age , and what happened the book happened , and what happened is the phot@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
when profess@@ ors get curious , they often often pus@@ wn in in such some research me@@ ster .
no , the lies i &apos;m talking about has has to do to fo@@ ke yourself .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um that helps you on your lea@@ ps .
so , we were able to connect the little digital spr@@ de head connected to ro@@ ro@@ tor control .
so the nervous cells are the information process@@ process@@ company that these cell communities have up .
obviously is that it &apos;s very simple simple with a virus ; it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so , imagine if you were in in several places at the same time , how would that feel feel ?
we had a team last year of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston , train ge code code for code for america .
one method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve often used recently is evolution itself .
and there are so contro@@ versi@@ al things , like all these gene@@ tically engine@@ engine@@ plants on on the cor@@ ks .
so that you &apos;s as as citizens , you em@@ able able to just to con@@ with with with these scientific technologies .
because the floor the mo@@ mo@@ s@@ ses die , and the wind and the water was@@ hes the ground away .
they lie , they che@@ at , they they &apos;re conf@@ used and make produce really dr@@ ble shapes .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you cannot stay in here and now .
it &apos;s about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ happy the person is when that person thinks about their life .
back home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development vision a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin hood .
so the idea is that we actually engage engage people in where they do things together , collective tively .
well , an ill@@ ph@@ any is usually usually something that you find because you left it somewhere .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we &apos;ve actually determin@@ ed what the goal is .
they can go go and and create their own museum -- from all these pictures , they can grow their own colle@@ ction .
the the result is that i , no matter where i get from , i get treated as if i &apos;d been f@@ f@@ ed to the ground .
every year we lose lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that would need go back in circu@@ cles .
and yes , the discussion is always the the question , how far can you take a little bit of future future ?
i met m@@ r a@@ yers yers in 2008 , two years ago , at the wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall .
if anyone had built a three-@@ in@@ ch high construction , he would have carrying the price home .
they &apos;ve re@@ formed the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of the earth in a way that it hasn &apos;t done any war .
three billion hours a week are not nearly nearly enough to solve the most ur@@ gent problems in the world .
but not only that -- so they mer@@ ge and connect to the universe and other devices out there .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of of my life trying trying trying to be myself , and ada@@ pt at the same time .
i don &apos;t want this thing thing break break into 20 parts , as you know from docum@@ docum@@ ent@@ ations .
and the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ began when i got my first digital camera camera , when i was 15 years 15 .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press at the pen .
so i wanted to create something else , something the process starts begins when the cause is supp@@ ses .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to pur@@ de to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the chemicals chemicals that in chemicals have distribu@@ ted at un@@ similar amount .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that is in@@ di@@ c , but it &apos;s also very spa@@ time .
so what can three billion growing growing , healthy , educ@@ educ@@ ated , productive productive members of the human community bring us ?
so for these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became became another material .
and because you obs@@ obs@@ , you &apos;re taken taken by the mind . how can you be har@@ m ?
so people thinking of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at time have mis@@ sed a lot the biology .
there &apos;s an old african ada@@ saying : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
in h@@ oll@@ and , , you easier easier understand understand understand , because in h@@ oll@@ and and , the country building up on flo@@ wers .
this is really important because this is a reali@@ zation that doesn &apos;t exist in a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ te .
so if we can do that , then this data tra@@ p , will become a new source of useful information .
and there &apos;s certainly ambi@@ gu@@ ity about how bad they &apos;re going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically typical , you get about six six have have stable structures .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared , a shared language language or preser@@ vation , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of ad@@ ver@@ en@@ ties , a perception of the i@@ , a sense of our own power .
if a mind has about these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new of being .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all nutri@@ ents they they only wish for without no effort on their own .

i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to to arts to with this digital medium and publi@@ c@@ c@@ ly pres@@ represent it online .
the program is called code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like peace sc@@ or@@ ps for computer fre@@ a@@ ks .
and certainly we could could have open these these hy@@ hy@@ dr@@ ants all all the time , and a lot of people people do .

you they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ fru@@ strated with her , but you don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it , you re@@ pair them .
now i say , &quot; computers , now take the 10 percent of the consequences that came next to my tures .
and another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single mar@@ ble .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories in order to use the time .

so all western emp@@ ires have always exp@@ ded , until they haven &apos;t get infrastructure anymore , and then they im@@ plo@@ ded .
now that &apos;s not exactly exactly cor@@ rect scienti@@ fically , because we don &apos;t know how much much it &apos;s being k@@ is@@ is@@ ed .
don &apos;t , it &apos;s wa@@ ness , children &apos;s play to@@ y , we &apos;ve figured it math , never &apos;t the math .
they found 500 incredibly creative creative solutions that they can read read if they goo@@ google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;

the last fall , it had to melt ct in@@ sol@@ ven@@ z because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked .
and then super@@ der@@ dered effects like p@@ ace and volu@@ strength that you apply on the whole sequence .
so what we have here are the cover of of every spor@@ ts illu@@ strated that ever prin@@ ted .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher by painting around , in hidden of my text@@ book .
in the entire city , for five years there &apos;s no no time plan@@ el , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing .

i know they &apos;ve been ra@@ c@@ sts , i know that they were sex@@ xi@@ ists , but they were great .
so we &apos;s starting to rely on computers for a process that is very different from classi@@ cal engineering engineering .
now i know it , and now i i &apos;m j@@ cting the front i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and if you place that in exactly the middle between between two same ha@@ arb@@ st@@ es , then it star@@ star@@ es .

and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to ness from no less than a mass e@@ migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds and online game environments . &quot;
but at the edge of your skills ill , so you have to fight up , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of war@@ craft .
today i &apos;m going to trans@@ you you what i otherwise musical , so interpre@@ t , , again into a verb@@ al language .
and by the way , the biggest in@@ sur@@ ance against a population explosion is a better par@@ enting and nutri@@ diet around the world .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything that an orche@@ str@@ a from at then used as an un@@ play@@ able .
that &apos;s why everyone who are here and are curious , are actually people people who have a property property that you can &apos;t learn .
and when it strug@@ f@@ ought through the system and leaving this off , the water is cle@@ aner than than the way it came in .
and we just just started with a relatively simpl@@ -@@ crazy story to ask , where could you make a memory a memory now today ?
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic species , the way in which which , the better you learn to know your fish , you the the more lo@@ love the fish .
players always believe that an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always time to try it , in the same time .
so we we , for the next global game , we a a bigger , more higher goal than just oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
the third thing that i learned -- and while the inner clock starts coun@@ count &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; down . &quot;
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer time scale .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process , using these particular information information , because evolution could now occu@@ place within an individual .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computers a much faster , so that we &apos;re able to be able to do these processes even even faster .
there &apos;s some of about it , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that , at that time , only only 14 patients per night .
and we even even tried to re@@ bring back back back back into the acade@@ mic world , but it &apos;s &apos;t kind of to there like way .
we can even start on the island island to integra@@ integr@@ ating mo@@ bility , asking out how to manage the bur@@ load .
we should in@@ in@@ in that half of us are spending an hour a day playing with games until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
and if you watch bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in play , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human lau@@ mon , dance dance and ritu@@ als .
one i fir@@ fir@@ believe believe is that when you can taking your opportunity , you take risks , there are opportunities in these risks .
every language is like an ol@@ d-@@ forest forest of mind mind a an fle@@ ction point , an thought , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
the answer is : they expect us to call call the doctor doctor the next morning , and ask for ask a change in pres@@ cri@@ ption .
about a week later there was a problem with the machine with these wir@@ here -- these golden wir@@ es .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the room between the stars , these wir@@ wir@@ es can hold the ten@@ sion .
he has trans@@ transl@@ ated the se@@ ero@@ tic@@ ways , the way he saw it , as they they acting for it at that moment .
and what happens if you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written hundred , or hundred hundred ago , or even three hundred years ago ?
others will do that for you . don &apos;t do to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-@@ being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how how difficult it is .
you see , it really needs only one human who &apos;s showing you how you mani@@ fest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
sol@@ er : with with the h@@ ul@@ c skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds across across kinds ter@@ rain , for many hours .
and the next post we &apos;ve gotten was that , &quot; i went over over there , found the tr@@ ash tons behind the house .
and then you ask them how they &apos;re their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they &apos;re , &quot; &quot; i thought you understand something of plants .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , because it wouldn &apos;t really sense to mind to question it question .
in other words , when we saw this image on september / 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
is it logi@@ cal that somebody should be expected to be afraid doing the work that they feel quie@@ on ?
so i think we out of the ha@@ cker@@ scene are already in the way even a step further than the world of acade@@ a .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth th sin@@ ph@@ ony , and he came came stage behind the stage to imagine himself .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i are fund@@ ing a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly ingly , tra@@ ws the nuclear approach .
the the conclu@@ sion from what i &apos;ve said here is that we should &apos;t think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ of well-@@ being .
my circle then back in the 6@@ 0s 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the gay box .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new spaces that provide enough space for a city and gave gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
or photos like this -- dark dark and color@@ ful at the same , but all with the shared obje@@ im to keep a reali@@ stic level .
there &apos;s no question question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than some choice .
computers ha@@ ck , and then in media media always like , yes , the ha@@ cker break somewhere somewhere and cla@@ data data and so on .
sh@@ am@@ ans , p@@ rie@@ sts , so-@@ knowledge guar@@ ri@@ ts , were extra extra ded to preser@@ tain knowledge in stories .
we &apos;re totally used , course , because we see on one hand , the new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook facebook and so on .
if you don &apos;t have that , that ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , you have to replace with health electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemistry .
and don &apos;t get wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , sort like that .
and how we consu@@ use it appe@@ seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that the re@@ e@@ der itself hol@@ ves for us .
sometimes people tell me , i look like i play &apos; d@@ d@@ th@@ es games , or that i remember her se@@ ven@@ ol@@ ds .
the amazing thing is that this way of store information is over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion billion years where it came in has rema@@ consi@@ same .
the next morning i wo@@ ke up and i didn &apos;t know if i just dre@@ ed this crazy commit@@ ment or had actually written it .
she knew she could do do moment she could do one , and that was -- in her words , &quot; running like the vil . &quot;
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fic@@ ction influence from my childhood .
they take that stuff and they take alterna@@ alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t &apos;t matter how often often we find they &apos;re us@@ eless .
an epi@@ c vic@@ is a result that which is so extremely positive that they didn &apos;t even know before that it was at possible .
here is a background forma@@ tion , to put that into this , and you &apos;re probably all about wikipedia , the world &apos;s &apos;s largest wi@@ ki .
the cloud is again , a cloud of image points , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles of particles .
at that point , we have multi-@@ ular communities , communities from many different cell types , which together together together as a single organis@@ m .
i gave my usual talk , and after then she looked at me and she said , &quot; h@@ mm . y@@ mm mm . h@@ mm . &quot;
on the y-@@ axis are a few good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of your country , the water supply .
and if we &apos;re already here in frank@@ fur@@ t the main , then i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ck institute for brain research .
i came up to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who his show in las v@@ eg@@ as his show in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
some of you will remember it was when it@@ al@@ y was playing fr@@ ance , and then at the end of zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ sho@@ ke .
well , that &apos;s just one example how we can feel the city today in a way we couldn &apos;t do few years ago .
and after terror@@ ism , of course , , the ra@@ gre@@ ra@@ came came and decades of ra@@ c@@ cally motiv@@ ated sur@@ mission and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
like the cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows us to build much larger , complex complex cy@@ cles , a stone after a other .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ cal moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
but the ab@@ han@@ den of a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery ery , and , i guess , cat@@ astrop@@ he .
and not only in art , also in k ology , in the in the my@@ th@@ ology in stories , it appe@@ again .
&quot; that true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re out so far , that the waste of our fish is distribu@@ ted , &apos;t focus . &quot;
and no , it didn co@@ ok the fish and it &apos;s not not a co@@ f . at least in the way that you you and i understand it .
my reaction to that was the drawing and painting of ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , robots robots , spac@@ ec@@ raft and all that stuff .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the most important person .
then he looked at my face and he said , &quot; oh no , don &apos;t you make you crazy crazy about the conversation with grand@@ a ? &quot;
the head of of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to start a test project with hundred un@@ its in developing countries .
the en@@ v@@ ing power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians who understood him , who recogni@@ his talent and and looked at him .
so if you have to dep@@ dep@@ end on these sources you have a way to get the energy when when it &apos;s not available in time .
suppose i said that through few changes in your genes , could have better memory -- pre@@ cise , specific and faster .
we have very very difficult con@@ these now -- maybe not as as open as the medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
so , to tell you this ten@@ sion , i first have to know that i &apos;m a big fan of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
when i was a kid , there was future somewhere in year 2000 , and people talked about what would happen to happen year 2000 .
we have a legal system in this country country will treat them much better when they &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and inno@@ inno@@ cent .
when i walked up the sta@@ ir@@ to the court , there was an older , black man , the jan@@ it@@ r in the court .
it tou@@ ched something deeply inside me : identity , the ability of every individual to contribu@@ te something to a community , to a hope point of perspective .
so , the mobile phone in your po@@ cket costs about million times less , and is a thousand times faster a super@@ super@@ computer in the 7@@ 0s .
well it turns out you you take each of the 17 17 vari@@ ants at the full moon , and you sing sing it to you in a different clay .
when hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and you buy one that dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ting , and you ask ask why , who &apos;s responsible ? ?
in hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest ice e@@ berg , you see high new la@@ kes that were were gl@@ aci@@ ers a few years ago .
these are some kids who got a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try it , and took a video from it .
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor times better than the approach@@ that we have at the time .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the century , the per@@ at@@ ators of the earth , could never have dre@@ am@@ ed such of lux@@ ury goods .
and today i had time to show you some of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
here on the left a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia called the hou@@ se-@@ of-@@ nature fi@@ fi@@ , , and they have there for a long time .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , you don &apos;t longer longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain certain in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the net .
thank you . just to understand understand ter@@ ra@@ power better -- first first , can you give us a idea of the scale of this investment ?
by the way , i would mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
and so i went to the the world of technology to see how i could use to provide magic rather than kill .
because ultimately ultimately we talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commit@@ ment , to be able to live in a complex world .
dis@@ ha@@ m of this fact : america is one one of the only countries in the world in where vac@@ tation for meas@@ numbers are fall@@ down .
every day you give + + add a magni@@ size about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every you you have to record two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
so the people who see a marine prote@@ cted area , that are benefit from the gli@@ insi@@ ght that it allows , can can re@@ back their standard values .
if you at an ic@@ e@@ berg , you think think be isol@@ isol@@ , separ@@ separate and alone , no the way we humans often see .
and today we want to introdu@@ ce this not not as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u what the product calls called , but also as the a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
now i can now ori@@ this mental negoti@@ ation model , sele@@ ec@@ , in@@ in@@ form , trans@@ trans@@ fer to an interaction system .
the reason reason you &apos;re often pres@@ doing different kinds of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
can you come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come come along with the man that i know that you found him in between .
and that &apos;s , of course , where you start and look look and say , &quot; okay , now i &apos;m just going to look into the inside itself .
you read read in the letters , journ@@ als , , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of the com@@ pos@@ itself .
it sc@@ ared that i could lose the ability , enjoy the sun@@ set with a camera and without t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
i &apos;m going to quickly quickly three three that i &apos;ve designed to try and give people epi@@ epi@@ c vic@@ tory in their own future .
only different economic changes have influ@@ enced enced it , and we need to go go from a rapi@@ pid pid pid increase to re@@ duc@@ ction and to re@@ redu@@ ction up to zero .
the reason is i help to create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and visual visual effects .
so we thought that we would embra@@ ce this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help ack@@ deal with this problem .
which brings to the second technology que that helps them deal deal with the problem of decision decision over@@ very , it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
and to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate has gone from 25 percent percent percent to 80 in the 1@@ 30 years .
we teach our students all all these technologies together , very focused on how these can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
that &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters about the genetic code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that ever created by humans .
more importantly , are you physical , why you can move them like building blocks , simply ely by stre@@ exten@@ ching your hands and and interven@@ ing ?
why we sele@@ choose the vac@@ ation that we looking for is a problem that en@@ es us with a sel@@ ec@@ ing between two types of self .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily pri@@ le@@ le@@ es the the biggest , the stron@@ gest , or the fa@@ st@@ st@@ est , and not the smar@@ smar@@ test .
and i should mention that i have got pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and that i want you to hur@@ ry please . &quot;
i have friends who make big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies , and i have friends making make indepen@@ day movies like me .
since this was completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey &apos;s nee &apos;s funny funny idea and argument argument was looked five five million times .
if you think that the left line is is s@@ wing and the ad on the right ja@@ zz , then cla@@ p into your hands .
if you think that one on the left is ja@@ zz , and which , on the right is s@@ wing , please cla@@ cla@@ please .
ad@@ ding ding opportunities into people lives of people inevi@@ ably incre@@ ases the expec@@ tations tations people people have about how good these these possibilities will be .
we knew about a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ological re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair pair dna that that can assem@@ those pieces like this .
and that &apos;s all about explor@@ explor@@ ing a city by looking in places places was positive or negative t@@ t@@ ed .
a child that &apos;s born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live for as long as the rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago .
i think the most interesting result that we found on the gall@@ up po@@ ll is a number that we absolutely &apos;t expect expect to find .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , final man@@ ager at youtube . a professional , i look at youtube videos .
and it conne@@ us all together to something is much bigger , and it &apos;s able to evol@@ evol@@ ve faster than we &apos;ve been been .
groups like anony@@ mous have up over the last 12 months months and have become one of the main players players in the field of online attac@@ ks .
the most beautiful is how you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that surro@@ you in the everyday , that that they don &apos;t learn in the school .
we built the pieces so that we could just break them down with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair it and ins@@ them back together .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because each of every coffee ffe@@ machine machine actually actually much more sophisti@@ cated technology than most of the lab equipment , that &apos;s really like way .
again , people different skin skin color , dep@@ based on an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ties before an@@ atom@@ ic differences , again , again , success@@ fully .
it &apos;s not death when they mel@@ melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but an continu@@ ction of your path along the life cycle .
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ any that that i talked talking about showed out .
now we can &apos;t all all the tom@@ i brand , but i often at the interface of dark glamour and liquid fly .
i believe that , if you train your employees to avoid avoid risks , you prepared the whole company to get a prof@@ its .
so the question i to ask you is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you can see they &apos;re &apos;t going going forever forever .
they began to train speci@@ alists within the community , special specific structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and cap@@ turing information .
for me , means bring time , to think and to talk about the poor , the most advan@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , the ones who will never be at ted .
so i sign the des@@ ab@@ ment pers , and a bu@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce and res@@ assi@@ assi@@ came came and brought them home .
there were bun@@ der@@ ci@@ ks of about 20 in@@ ches , black schil@@ in mouth brea@@ ks , an under@@ nature of the al bar@@ pers .
until the day day , they are gover@@ run by a ritual ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , the training to p@@ pri@@ es@@ od od od is very extraordinary .
my ja@@ w was down , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i like to have the way which was once the only way . &quot;
you you see , it gro@@ ws on the dark blue , this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in the winter , and it s@@ hr@@ ul@@ ul@@ in in summer .
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , , like like &apos;s kind of of air pressure mp that sho@@ ot@@ ing about that far , two centi@@ meters or something .
each uses this uses and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , and stands stands for gui@@ ented , sel@@ sele@@ ction , , in@@ formed , tran@@ sa@@ ting .
we &apos;re trying mini@@ mini@@ mi@@ ze environmental foot@@ print , but it &apos;s all about having a big foot@@ print print that is useful .
every sound , every phr@@ ase will it sense of it , because i feel it myself myself , because it &apos;s beginning to lea@@ out from my personal work .
the question was simple , math that was two-@@ sand@@ sand@@ 2006 , the first cont@@ acts started with the island , let &apos;s just go through through .
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ ther , skin , bone fl@@ our , ste , dri@@ dry , and process@@ it for food . &quot;
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s still used , and every time it makes makes the picture bigger than the sum of the fil@@ le .
so the circle closed between my existence existence as a science fi@@ ction fan then a child and the trans@@ lation into reality .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , which the genome pas@@ ces , the rest of the body becomes becomes des@@ pri@@ ased .
they really really out out out , because that leads to an extra@@ ordin@@ sely toler@@ ant society , in which le@@ th@@ al violence has never been obser@@ seen yet .
that means i can just just an intui@@ tive , human model on software software and make the software much more useful .
it &apos;s not our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ mon@@ , , our insi@@ sever@@ on greater food , , better food , unique food .
you know , there &apos;s a reason the the average word of war@@ cra@@ ty players plays playing hours 22 hours a week , sort of a partic@@ time job .
and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that that each of us in our gut has more more bacteria than cells in the rest of our body ?
why do people spend 15 15 to 30 percent more on they use an ec@@ card or they use a card card , than on bar@@ ash ?
i colle@@ cted a little team of people who for which the bla@@ wer &quot; not not not &quot; an un@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
so we had , for example designers designers with no no ever experience electr@@ onic things , who started to with li@@ rt leb@@ its as a material .
this is a shot of real design software that &apos;re working on , where you &apos;re actually sit on and know new species new species on computer design .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked every morning in the mirror and asked him , who is the most beautiful beautiful in the country ?
according her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , 18 years , fam@@ ine didn &apos;t get better , so the king decided to do a final fel@@ game .
we have difficult conver@@ about , at what point a body becomes to human , so that it has a different right than fe@@ tal life .
i &apos;m poli@@ pro@@ gressi@@ tically , i &apos;m de@@ f@@ ding people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me nervous .
i went to a clean room with new new silicon silicon sli@@ ces , and i ck@@ ed for 100 hours on all the big devices .
so in these plans , we &apos;ve had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that are off@@ ering to to people something between between between two to 9 different f@@ on@@ ds .
a whole re@@ mix community came out of the ground , which made it from a sil@@ stupid jo@@ ke to something that that we all participa@@ te in .
we got to a point that is is anal@@ o@@ g at the time when one-@@ cell@@ ular organisms evolved multi-@@ cell organisms .
in these opportunities , the em em started un@@ t@@ ely and in@@ t@@ act on on paper paper -- but back@@ back@@ wards -- from the last word to the first .
the hard step is building the first re@@ actor , to find more billions , the regul@@ aries and the place that will actually build the first them .
bill , i think i talk for almost all people here when i say , i really hope your your wish will be true . thank you , very much .
i call it as the &quot; in life am i bad , , &quot; and it &apos;s actually actually my face , see ? yes ? ok .
but it was still a arms race against the other volunte@@ ers to reach the the responsible man and to figure out what our tas@@ would be .
it &apos;s a terrible model for a le physi@@ physi@@ ist , because they &apos;re playing with with gro@@ floor bar@@ ells , but but with these little strange particles .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws laws deter@@ mine that you can &apos;t dis@@ ress exi@@ sting hous@@ identi@@ al ow@@ ners .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who try to re@@ discover their parents that , in some cases , they haven &apos;t seen seen for a decade .
and i have 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms from a white pul@@ se , which i &apos;m trying to keep ti@@ ms from security sper@@ ers in air@@ por@@ ts .
the childhood childhood ritual is brought back . you have to go out and to take and mar@@ tag a picture picture of a flo@@ wer of a flo@@ wer .
now , i &apos;m not that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , bio@@ diversity loss , water gen and energy problems -- that &apos;s what what already have .
the fish reasons of these bun@@ ci@@ ia were very productive , and the fis@@ her@@ men men lived well well them and deser@@ ned in ghana ghana an average well .
there was a time when i was a boy , so you could have every phone provi@@ der you wanted to as long as he came from ma bell .
so you really have look in the detail detail if i want to do something user , or intui@@ tively hand@@ man@@ able , what what does that mean in the core ?
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to leave with with today , and failure is is really an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
but in the first three fac@@ , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to to most best , 13 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just doesn &apos;t enough .
so , it goes , right here where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;ll just just make a little box .
and these are not the properties of old media and and they har@@ dly access the media of today , but they &apos;re going to the entertain@@ ment of the future .
he &apos;s a et , a writer , a man whose whole life was connected by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
again letter a letter falls down and me -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live live -- that &apos;s really add@@ ressed to me .
i resi@@ stant to a teaching here in tor@@ onto , when m@@ s. prin@@ ter was to me into the cy department of the hospital hospital .
they put their hands together and they started sing@@ &quot; al@@ la@@ h , , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god god , god . &quot;
and the commercial device costs costs about five thousand euro@@ euro@@ s up@@ , or something like that , com@@ pen@@ ds around about fif@@ ty .
and when i tell someone , give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ ffer , they &apos;ll think about the right first , where &apos;s something inside .
i &apos;m now about basically imple@@ fying this whole environmental discussion , world discussion , four@@ ty years of clu@@ b@@ of-@@ ro@@ me , , in quality .
i have a plan for it . want to convince more people , including all of you to spend more time with games playing bigger and great games .
so i talked about you@@ th lo@@ emplo@@ ess@@ ness and education , and the g@@ g@@ ability of the mar@@ g@@ alized and un@@ cap@@ tan@@ ated .
so after this funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to want to go go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous ous time machine , going into the future ? &quot;
and one of the things i found really really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
we all want to be stars cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers com@@ edi@@ ans ans -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ itely difficult .
then it goes into the past , and so very very elegan@@ to bridge wait times , for example , on the computer if i know this phenomenon .
and of course , it break heart of you to hear that that conver@@ wards , one-@@ one-@@ scho@@ ol@@ ers had being told , they they &apos;re just enough .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia , and i believed that these fore@@ sts are to be to be being e@@ ed .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , that &apos;s moving with others , completely syn@@ chr@@ ony .
and what we found was that the more more fund ds were ered that , indeed , participa@@ tion was lower .
interest@@ ingly , it &apos;s that that , we &apos;re looking at something that which is actually a self-@@ com@@ hen@@ hen@@ bility , but it &apos;s not that that .
these are the kind of thoughts that can someone to at nine in the morning start king queen , and i don &apos;t want .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a spr@@ board , and it &apos;s over over the edge .
and i , up on the picture i a lec@@ lec@@ ture in in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical medical museum , in combin@@ combin@@ combin@@ ation with an show on the subject .
we all heard about fe@@ en and n@@ y@@ mp@@ es , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much significant than buying buying circum@@ stances en@@ hit the same same explosion of choice .
people who have never been ed have never felt inst@@ inst@@ directly with their own body exactly what it &apos;s like to make a sound .

now if you look at the way that these chemicals were organi@@ organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they were doing it .
so i &apos;ve have a new generation of programs that come created by combin@@ ations of programs that come a little closer closer to the lec@@ ance than others .
and it &apos;s only only sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct after life ability , production production of chemicals or fuel production vac@@ acc@@ ine and so on .
that means for a child who spent spent achie@@ achie@@ of the grand@@ year spent most of of the time of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .

the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be who they are without without having to change change the will of the state .

everything that we eat , every ri@@ ce , every pe@@ ter@@ sil@@ , , every fl@@ our , was changed by the people .

are you not afraid of you writing your whole life and never creating a book that anyone interested in the world ? never ? &quot;
one night sta@@ yed for too long , and thought , my god , if a ju@@ dge can transform us into something else , he needs to have magic forces .

in an interaction of the book , you send to search search and you have to go out and with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ collect images of natural objects .
once then , s. car@@ r called me , and he said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , wife par@@ park coming to the city . we want to talk conversation .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong , so so i click click this where which show me all all the spending in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong was mentioned .

i was the one who every week in the virg@@ id room green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without without ra@@ ping the country on which they live on .
a p@@ ill twice a day is not as good as three p@@ ills ills -- i can &apos;t remember the ex@@ rate statistics statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
i loved loved love to go to this business , but at one point i wonder@@ ed , well , how come you you never buy anything ?
we sett@@ down in foot@@ sc@@ ray , which is work@@ er-@@ class lived sub@@ ur@@ b where whose population is made of im@@ migr@@ ants .
i could also take ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the u.s. nobody li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es in so far away , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
we have lost trust in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science of itself itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
of course it &apos;s &apos;s held there , but not the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , through my ti@@ finger ers , which is now there .
and i spent 30 days eating eating nothing than this -- wal@@ ks at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at end .
then , community community of people people who shared this this big jo@@ ke , and started started talk about it and and playing around with it .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to avoid the new challenges and to do what it needs for .
but anyway it is now it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely a frame where it becomes much more available .
that means , the whole western civili@@ zations history story gro@@ to fact that the city has only taken , but the farmers never never given farmers anything anything .
well , he continu@@ on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system for the fish to eat what they going to eat in the wild .
when you get on this way where belief and and magic plac@@ places ds evidence and and science , you going to get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be in .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ because of the story i told you you the day about the and@@ re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
and i called her up and i ta@@ ked her knowledge to compare her exper@@ se to what we had found in the code and and in the data .
so the idea is , apart than showing that br@@ ands are a part of life , actually actually going to get you to fund the film ?
of the people who left stopped when they were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of br@@ ade .
in the plans that ned ered almost 60 million ds , participa@@ tion rate has now gone to about the six@@ th percentage .
now it turns out that even when you decide tend to participa@@ te , when more choices are are for choice , even then , it has negative consequences .
in fact this mountain of be@@ b@@ bers are acc@@ colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ every time when they go to into areas where they &apos;ve never fis@@ fis@@ in .
you will con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence that you were in an earlier form is not just the way you &apos;d like to present the evidence .
and so i compared what i got to what i was expected , and what i had was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting compared to what i expe@@ cting .
so , to reach that 80 percent , , the developed states , including countries like china , have to re@@ turn their electricity generation .
and i wonder wondering what you would choose , because i asked my friends a a lot asked this question , , and they all wanted to go to the past .
and i &apos;ve probably ed from my memor@@ ies of this three-@@ week long journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
we feel over@@ el@@ med . we feel de@@ fe@@ ated ; we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated ated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
and , the biggest question i &apos;m asked asked recently , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum museum museum museum ? &quot;
my current work is to designing designing objects with such a complexity complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these them in the traditional sense .
i grew up on the country in in cold , south , and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year year yo@@ unger sister .
but then the technology technology of electro@@ ly@@ se developed and made made al@@ umin@@ um so so cheap for we use it with our thro@@ wa@@ way ment@@ ality .
and maybe i &apos;ve been enough in business business like i me give provide a piece of my own wrong talk to make this happen .
instead of having to progra@@ mming , wir@@ te or resol@@ solve it , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allows you to program with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so , to speed ate or slow down the blind , just fli@@ tate on this butt@@ on and it makes the moment@@ um faster or slow .
dan gil@@ bert made a great point point this morning by telling much much the way in which we &apos;re u@@ ating things depen@@ depen@@ ds on what we &apos;re compar@@ ing it .
question is , of course , what is really the most intui@@ tive act of of humans humans and now i &apos;ve already it ?
but the truth is that we change changing . of course we &apos;re driven by the challenge , whether it physical physical emotional emotional or even both .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in ist ist east germany , , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had regi@@ regi@@ it in the government .
they call themselves the older older brothers and they say that who we are the yo@@ unger unger brothers , are responsible for the responsible of the destruction of the world .
i think the fact it &apos;s so hard , the fact fact that we reach beyond our limit@@ ies , creates the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
this is a network from the u.s. states , which is actually actually more of kind of for@@ um um , where you can just arri@@ ting and discus@@ uss online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a a little business business , , and then they &apos;re asking like , , , really applied questions .
so we can do things now now that that when they disappe@@ ar , when when they break , , they can do them in biological cy@@ cles .
here &apos;s a company that tried to solve what became this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for our for our , and how do we going to keep fish on our men@@ cards ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally many billion times than any kind of waste age you can think of of nuclear things and other things ?
i won &apos;t go into the details . it &apos;s not longer anymore pain@@ ful today , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was condu@@ cted in the 199@@ 0s .
of course , it was a great , old syn@@ ony@@ m tion@@ ary , and i just thought that the copy has really have to be pretty old .
why don &apos;t the frequ@@ ability of a ken jen@@ jen@@ n@@ &apos;s , especially especially if you can exp@@ tend it with the next next generation of wat@@ son machine ?
but because they lack this this individual the cep@@ tors to to recognize the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
it starts with the sex lines , then then the no@@ u@@ es come , then the bush h-@@ publi@@ le@@ ment , and and at the last , people actually do art .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more it interesting when these dro@@ p@@ ks learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
and i i want to tell to you you who see also this , just say : don &apos;t lose your goal out your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
through not participa@@ tion , they give up to 5,000 us dollars a year from the emplo@@ emplo@@ yer who would been happy to repli@@ their contribu@@ tion .
and the more possibilities there are choice choice the more attra@@ ctive ctive its of this choice is given into the op@@ isi@@ city costs .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , you feel feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about it , they bl@@ use yourself .
but these oil dro@@ p@@ were not about like alive in the modern sense , because every single one of them was just a small , random pres@@ cri@@ ption of chemicals .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y like ted willi@@ ams &apos;s le@@ gen@@ y the last major lea@@ gue gue baseball , who who met , during a regular seas@@ on on met over 400 times .
then your brain waves were measu@@ red and depen@@ ding on what you thought , or how you &apos;ve thought , is then then add@@ ted ed different lights in the room .
you know , there are lots of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to move forward forward .
anthro@@ pol@@ sts have found that we humans have asked one from members of our society : to be useful useful and do contribu@@ tion .
funny , we also also had to break in the par@@ king lot , so we were also right as as part of the spra@@ scene .
so in a power station for example , when the ste@@ am tur@@ tur@@ bine gets too fast , you have to open open load val@@ ves within milli@@ seconds .
you can put it comm@@ mar@@ , you send send your friends , and you can start a conversation about what you feel feel when you look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past even though we live in educ@@ ated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
so my com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;ll to give , ves to c@@ amer@@ on to order to tate &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
and i argue argue it &apos;s &apos;s more likely to become become vic@@ ti@@ ms of online crime crime , than a fra@@ gi@@ rup@@ le in the real world .
and of those ,000 languages today , while we &apos;re here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , just half of them don &apos;t longer being wh@@ is@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
and this is on a higher gra@@ gra@@ l of us@@ kin@@ as the of of trans@@ mission of a classi@@ cal metaphor , which is part of the des@@ k@@ top .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve out the part that &apos;s bur@@ burning today today , so it &apos;s called consum@@ ed ur@@ ur@@ um .
for the next 20 percent will produced in poor poor countries , well still a some agriculture . hopefully forest est@@ dung and and ement ement going going to clean clean to that .
you can actually look from the bottom , share the most moments moments for ic 20@@ 12 12 and over@@ scen@@ ders , and use use it as a kind of connection to the community .
then she said , &quot; remember next that you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; even it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
our ability to write genetic code has very slowly slowly but but still increas@@ increasing , and our final point is now going to to to an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
and how we see things , what we pay at , and how we , , in , , , , against our environment against our environment , in so that allows us able think do accor@@ proper@@ ately .
in the descri@@ ption of my speech is written that as an interpre@@ t , i understand as as a transl@@ ator , which is in in english english word sense .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i do pi@@ vo@@ vo@@ t is that , after a certain cause of death i can filter ot let &apos;s say acci@@ dents .
we have to break@@ through@@ s with full gas , and we can measure measure that : in corpo@@ rate numbers , in mush@@ room projects and regu@@ regu@@ lation changes .
you can know how happy someone is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t you much about how happy they live their life and conver@@ sa .
only if you get another different example , so immediately you immediately it the a ha@@ st@@ pi@@ le , then also doesn &apos;t really need no reason reason ity and at nothing .
we trust that somebody sp@@ time with us , that we keep the rules rules , that we have the same goal goal and we stay there until the end game .
do you have perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use angle &quot; , because that got a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you you know how this going to develop ?
and as you see , even something like de@@ meter , the most c@@ al bio@@ , yes agriculture , doesn not allow to allow our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ oli@@ cs back .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t yet saved the real world yet .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , develop something called called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is o@@ vari@@ an tissue is filled by ho@@ den@@ d tissue .
it seems like our our culture is in pra@@ g@@ matic matic post@@ titude , &quot; well , we have to draw a line somewhere , so let &apos;ll pull them anywhere . &quot;
but you could go to a completely new , build a whole new hous@@ ing , provi@@ ing the laws there would support to such kind a and wouldn &apos;t stop it .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words words of a teacher have meaning , but that the words of a de@@ dic@@ ged teacher are particularly meaning@@ ful .
and i lived through this roll@@ er@@ aster , because after after st@@ she came to the inten@@ sive unit , and i hop@@ ing she was going to re@@ cover .
you see , we sur@@ fing on the web first as though it &apos;s also really a web , not just page to page but much more abstra@@ ct .
but if we cut the price down -- let &apos;s hal@@ the price -- we hit to a new bar@@ rier , and that bar@@ rier conne@@ ds with co2 .
and if you have that assu@@ mption , then you understand the lo@@ gic with which we have this fortun@@ to to improve our world through a lie .
everything that you can see in this picture has been built within within four years after it took four years to keep the per@@ mit@@ s .
well , in the last decade years in humans humans &apos;ve obser@@ seen three major negative consequences consequences that it is to provide more and more and choices choices .
my favorite one is in the middle -- -- mp@@ 3@@ -@@ play@@ player , nas@@ a-@@ ha@@ ha@@ tri@@ tri@@ , and cr@@ cr@@ Ã¨@@ me br@@ d@@ Ã©@@ e fac@@ et .
now , it &apos;s even more amazing when you imagine that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh 20 tons and shif@@ ted about 30 in@@ ches .
if i don &apos;t fight poverty poverty , i as the help help of a fire@@ ghter head@@ man , in a volunte@@ er ger i fight the fire .
and since you haven heard of me as the woman who &apos;s around here at ted in your under@@ wear -- -- that means is i &apos;ve found a few things .
about the environmental crisis , one problem problem the last 10 years that children are sitting in their rooms , on their computers without without ing out .
but a li@@ p pen , even in this ligh@@ ting , i can tell you , is completely in@@ in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s virtu@@ ally effective , right ?
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a well-@@ thri@@ ving bird population isn not the last thing you want to have on a fish report ? &quot;
the fact is if you could only reduce price from one thing , to poverty poverty , energy would far the most effective .
we found one for them , we brought them back , and and we took care of them , and we gave them up to their family because it needed needed .
i needed somebody who could interven@@ ade into my head , somebody who could help help me understand what &apos;s called called &quot; brand@@ ing person@@ ality . &quot;
you saw it with flu flu this year , &apos;re always always a year back and have a dollar too when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed -- -- when we read read the genetic code , it was exactly exactly what we trans@@ formed .
i don &apos;t know if this created biggest ju@@ ble , or this is when someone was vis@@ to google page , and somebody imag@@ ented the starting page like this .
and i just just ct that that , in the next 30 years we have same same capacity of chemical stor@@ stor@@ all over the world .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist los angeles times , one day went walked through the streets in the center of los angeles , he he heard a wonderful music .
and when i close my hand , what happens happens i turn turn back , and through that movement , bor@@ allow the finger to move back again .
why ? this picture descri@@ descri@@ descri@@ pretty much why i believe that games are so vi@@ tal for the survival of human human species in the future . seriously .
adap@@ tive technologies technologies have been allowed me me to learn learn to sk@@ again , clim@@ b , and even drive my hands bi@@ cycle .
so that raised attention attention and we started a lab lab project where infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ x@@ net , and investi@@ exam@@ at this ct .
and then we looked for ti@@ ms and data structures and tried to link connect together with the real world -- with potential potential tar@@ gets in real real world .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next de@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is burning burning fossil fu@@ els .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music , then then make it sound about another possibility , so about an instrument , to to sound .
and yet , you also don &apos;t tell your teacher teacher that you like to put bri@@ es somewhere and get gla@@ happy when the fire ro@@ ws up after@@ wards .
and of course , there are teams that have much more ta@@ -@@ da ima@@ also , and among the best ones are fresh gradu@@ ates of the garten .
later i found discovered that , around the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have been thinking thinking pl@@ thinking about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble brought various head and shoul@@ ders species species from 26 to 15 , they experi@@ en@@ essed a increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
and yes , much of what what was said very tou@@ ched by today , because there been many , many beautiful expres@@ about it , that i &apos;ve also through through .
since , in the 40 years that have now collap@@ strated , i &apos;ve spent about three ,000 hours under@@ under@@ water , 500 hours of them in mer@@ di@@ bles .
its completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s the cru@@ t@@ ap@@ s that send signals to our on@@ bo@@ bo@@ ard computer , which is atta@@ wired here on your back .
because they moved the middle man , and they walked around the agen@@ cies and said that the agen@@ cies may don &apos;t really really have their interest in the mind .
because if all things made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , &apos;t all all follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
we pay great looking at new technologies , but for progress progress , it require technologies and laws , and and it &apos;s usually laws laws that keep us back .
because at that point an individual individual -- is now happened within the period of the lifetime pan of a single organis@@ m , rather op@@ posed over this evolutionary evolutionary time .
first , how smo@@ as it goes -- in in good and in bad times -- war war or peace , rec@@ rec@@ ession , depression and high jun@@ e ture .
you can see this when we create these kinds of ws where we can pen@@ et@@ through through images , and make this experience experience of several multiple resol@@ ution ution .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ ec@@ er , that , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , or you know , , that &apos;s what it be be .
the last images i want to show you is an ic@@ e@@ berg i shot in ke@@ ker@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
so what is it an idea ins@@ ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in compe@@ competition for new citizens ?
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation , and somebody brea@@ together , is it your own relative relative or or else else , you can find an a@@ ed .
i became big in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ american hold , was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ arch@@ y , and that matri@@ matri@@ arch@@ ine was my grandmother .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l 199@@ 9 gave complete control over a area that is bigger than california and texas texas together .
because if you just read about it , from six@@ dar@@ liter@@ ature , it &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself yourself or seen .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ ed by energy unit .
that &apos;s how you can see that doesn &apos;t move any time , . as i can press here , nothing can migra@@ go into my sle@@ ev@@ es or get out .
i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian -- because the life of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s made made of more than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is really leader to start and thinking about questions of democracy .
even though choo@@ a ge@@ es tells me about my pre@@ fer@@ on the inner ior fit@@ ement , it still prepared to choose to sele@@ ct .
i go to study study prison and i visit a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 14 years old , and who &apos;s supposed to court in court as an adult .
oh , they go to a cock@@ tail party party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
because in usually through this new kind of us@@ ability , the natural user Ã­@@ n@@ ter@@ faces , we &apos;re about five times faster than on average on our goal .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- new new that &apos;s not just natural natural , but led and decided decided from us as as individual , in the decisions that we make .
and he said , &quot; no , only only if you &apos;re to higher level of social and you have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can really do that .
i think it &apos;s hard hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth worth to address some some really known br@@ ands .
important is that a individual or group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a stand@@ point shared shared with a big audience , and there@@ there@@ acceler@@ ate the process .
we were told that that if it went over the normal chan@@ els , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
or if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet where i study a lot recently , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
if i invi@@ you to dinner dinner and say , , , yeah , there &apos;s a tab@@ let with open@@ open -@@ taste and there a a glass of water .
if i take the next decade , i &apos;m confi@@ dent for two things : that we can create any future that uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able able , and that that we can play all sorts possible games .
when i found the master , he just had in a very serious conversation with the house ow@@ ner , who was had one of the worst worst days of their life .
so if a single at@@ om can be the same time in two different places , this piece piece metal can be in two different different places , why not &apos;t you as either ?
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent then co@@ ca@@ -@@ -@@ col@@ a is going to apply this technology glob@@ glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries all around the planet .
we are light years from making people , and our goal is mer@@ simply that we have a chance to survive long long enough to do that . thank you very much .
but to be fair -- the group chemi@@ sts have &apos;t over the cent@@ u@@ ries have &apos;t not received the repu@@ tation of al@@ co@@ al@@ cted man@@ ic depres@@ sive people .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ con@@ had a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te chemicals outside and grow grow them .
it became sil@@ ent . a woman said , &quot; with our history , it it &apos;s impossible , that we &apos;re ever re@@ re@@ vo@@ ourselves to the syste@@ matic killing of people .
today , i don &apos;t know may come tomorrow in la@@ gos on a airplane , and he &apos;s going to los angeles , and at the moment he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
about three or four years years ago in the middle of the night a phone call from this teacher , po@@ sten , who said , &quot; i have to see her .
what i want to do is film about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the whole film is being fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
she &apos;s not particularly particularly scientific -- she puts a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a , and she ask the patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how &apos;s it it ?
so let go back , and 2.@@ 5 billion years , the earth was was a big , dying le stone um@@ um@@ e with a lot of chemicals flo@@ on it .
i remember i must been eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up one morning and went to the living room , all my cou@@ s@@ ins ins running around .
we designed a wrong resol@@ ad with high resol@@ ution display which is much higher than it &apos;s a regular ad ad , and we &apos;ve ad@@ ded extra content .
but i had very fortun@@ ate to meet him early early at three 10 years old , and so i was been in my school school , on his clas@@ ses .
so we &apos;re not battery battery maker , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the theme battery and and the subject network network and everything in between .
and none of these plants , we &apos;ve built over hundreds of five now in the last 20 years , and none of these facili@@ plants have been s@@ ab@@ ved .
through impro@@ ving , tried tried , and by studying consum@@ ers , i &apos;ve been trying to re@@ down this complicated complicated idea of the ter city city to down of the essential elements .
when people have freedom , then all of us is for to do the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ mi@@ ze our good good and no one has to decide for us .
imagine if , for example , your wife wife wife is sad , if you if you an@@ is@@ ed ed you , and you come with five ty ro@@ ses .
compared to the entire amount of climate -@@ changing materials in the atmosphere , that amount amount could double if we go through this critical point .
the red thre@@ ad that cts all of together is our depen@@ dence on carb@@ on-@@ based fu@@ els like dir@@ thy coal coal and foreign oil .
she &apos;s one of the leading ages here from this great talk , and she asked me if i give a lec@@ talk here and and pri@@ up my idea .
this is an picture of a large , new new city that was built in south korea -- much larger than the down@@ town bo@@ st@@ ton .
it won &apos;t take any long to be the reality that there will be the 1,000 1,000 human genom@@ es , and it &apos;s going to be available essi@@ available for everyone .
then wife s. car@@ turned turned to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you need to be , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
after some time of refle@@ cting it seems to me that in order able continue to write , i have to create a kind of sh@@ sh@@ prote@@ ing psych@@ ological design .
if we print it with a writing size of 10 and no di@@ stance , it would would inclu@@ de 14@@ 2 2 pages just just to print print this genetic code .
and the machines that do this , they are pretty expensive expensive , which you commer@@ cially buy , the che@@ est ones go on at four thousand euro@@ s .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not so that stupid and break itself the skin , just to conversation us for a few minutes . &quot;
a place where women run the reci@@ pe , say sex &quot; hi o , and the game determin@@ es the day -- where fun is is a serious business .
so i would feel much better better all the whole thing , if somehow we could demon@@ that that objects also also follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
it also puts me excited excited excited about the big product i &apos;m together , and so &apos;m prepared to to get motiv@@ motiv@@ motiv@@ me to be with an interest .
and i realized that not only only he had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ c knowledge about music music but he connected connected with a close close personal relationship to it .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical , but not the normal , and and would you really want to to poor poor gra@@ y y person if they really exi@@ them ?
and when we &apos;re fron@@ with a body that which actually us us doing something very different , it conf@@ uses us in terms of these categ@@ ori@@ ories .
these could be cu@@ ba services , or techni@@ cians , for example , just to make sure that the mel@@ ed a@@ a@@ ed is still still in its place in its place .
now there are some among us who in a sense for@@ for@@ forget that when i say say &quot; &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; i really mean different op@@ possibilities of being .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , because the c base base in ber@@ lin was the first one , 10@@ 10@@ 10@@ of five hundred y-@@ nine .
and i can say that because because now we now living living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully will never see again .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ ability of our death of our body occur@@ happens at the same moment in evolution happens as sexual re@@ production .
whereas ia , , can &apos;t , in all states can ve the same right that h@@ ein@@ rich has in all the states , and that &apos;s the right to mar@@ ry .
and a kind of digital glo@@ w me at night -- but most most importantly importantly , a new new of of experience for anyone who want to go to the top .
if you constantly keep the standard fau@@ standard choice making decision , that means you &apos;re over@@ asked , that he@@ es that i lose it .
now , for those of us who have given and@@ government government , &apos;s time time for us to think about the world that that we want to leave behind our children .
we believe because we &apos;ve been taught taught that the real question is is : did a human deser@@ to die for his at@@ ro@@ city ?
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty comes from this true background , the mirror ors can lie lie , it comes from that true out@@ age .
and it worked . again we created something magic gical and the effect in the audience was the same , but we did with the movie played a little bit more money .
a person who opened do@@ ors ors was my pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian at at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton ton in del@@ aware .
but you know what you would fall in , in these a@@ part@@ ments and in their environment , laws are to be order to avo@@ com@@ ation and to de@@ stra@@ ct from de@@ min@@ tion .
what they find is that the people who go from the many to to the low of chan@@ par@@ ties always pick and over choose the standard choice .
the process fe@@ on itself itself and becomes becomes , i think , auto@@ car cat@@ aly@@ st , the word for -- if something incre@@ ases its speed of change .
well , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate you need when you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with ss@@ ss@@ l-@@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted service , for example , like g@@ mail .
tri@@ ple@@ of these letters -- these letters co@@ co@@ code about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds ; and here there &apos;s single single determin@@ for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
they can move with the hand , they can percei@@ of each other , they can capture their mov@@ ements , and they can have a screen and they have a recei@@ ver .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt of power and can bring it for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery battery , that we kind of of simulation tively get out of six hours .
anyway , the part that had involved with curi@@ osity and science . it was all . it it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was kind to be curious . it was imagination .
i think we would all understand the con@@ that woo@@ dy allen expres@@ sed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
it could be open open a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant , h@@ ard wee@@ ches , turn a tr@@ ash mil@@ wer with a bag of rat .
we go through the same levels that multi@@ ell@@ ular organisms have done -- the abstra@@ ction of our ways that we cl@@ tain data , present pres@@ present , , process data .
and then your pu@@ p@@ ills exp@@ , they &apos;ve come in front of your head , and they look down and they s@@ hard , and then begin to tell their stories .
eight years ago i was the media lab , and i started explor@@ this idea how to put the power power of engineers engineers into the hands of artists artists and designers .
and these &apos;s , that &apos;s these are usually usually fairly young people , but the only thing that actually ites you all you is is this fascin@@ ation with the technology .
there &apos;s a adult self that lives in the present present and knows the present , is is able to experience the past again , but it &apos;s has just the present ence .
patient b clearly ered suff@@ ered more . his gut refle@@ ction longer longer , and every single of pain pain that patient a had had patient patient b and more .
but before i show you what i in it , i &apos;ll make a very public conf@@ ession , and this is , this is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
and she took me outside and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise promise you &apos;re not going to tell it it . &quot;
and by the way , if you want to do it , they write that that &apos;s best best in germany , all all the en@@ ligh@@ ment ment ties that they are in fr@@ ance .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ gen@@ cy , of fear , but also outside concent@@ ration , very deep ed in the resol@@ of a really difficult problem .
but we only will we only have brand x x a front sor sor , we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
and the movie film , we had over 500 companies that were up and down companies , and said said &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read , and then i ask ask you to cla@@ p , if you &apos;re willing to adop@@ take g@@ ary &apos;s supply .
so the things that make a look look stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
i once once in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 along with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , and he up a map , and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
now if i just wanted to get bigger view , i could think , &quot; ok , if i look at anything with bi@@ bi@@ ke driving ? &quot;
they can ta@@ ste in stron@@ ger social social ties than in real life , and they get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than in real life .
and as a result , his gen@@ al@@ als became male male ped , his brain was ex@@ posed posed to the most male male part of the hor@@ m@@ one spectrum .
so i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans if you want to build a new city , you have to start start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
and if you also want in@@ be citizens to to make ful decisions decisions in society and you want to talk to them , then you need the access to knowledge and to technology .
here we simul@@ late the entire trans@@ trans@@ mission tional system , the kilometers ter physics of c@@ able , sort of de@@ cate the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior in the grid .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , swe@@ den den and from canada , and they were all same : no cor@@ relation , no connection , no nothing .
but then he got older and quie@@ . he told me that one day he was driving on a ra@@ st@@ way street in los angeles , and &apos;s where everything changed for him .
when when the fing@@ ers move and right just as it &apos;s like in the notes , then they come sounds that sound together together sound sound like music .
and this &apos;s important because just just by looking at at web@@ sites in these way , , you can look at at the entire internet internet system in the the same way .
in the next planning elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a re@@ vel@@ um , its program promis@@ promis@@ es innova@@ and and well and sh@@ cation .
one or two two , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; br@@ br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my hu@@ hu@@ ce ? &quot;
the first con@@ blocks blocks made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and they came from a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le from z@@ ement with a fix@@ sted measure that fit together .
for me , the best living example how to do this the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its , i was able to interview interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we in terms to our work , decisions again and again and again , whether we should work or not to work .
he had x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ wom@@ wom@@ , his side ne@@ ys were so highly active that essentially basically creating a male hor@@ one environment .
so he starts to clim@@ up this old clim@@ bing in it , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and this song will will be tra@@ cked for forever .
and actually , the software ha@@ ers , in the &apos; 0s 0s &apos; 0s 0s started with computer tin@@ st@@ les , and that &apos;s how what also created of the internet .
imagine him by mar@@ ching the communic@@ ations in sa@@ ig@@ on , as he must ad@@ ined that his life had been a single waste .
op@@ tun@@ nel costs costs dro@@ k the happiness that we have through our choice , also when what we looked for is fantastic .
it was right middle the night , and she stood in the eping and bar@@ foot foot a was outside outside in the flo@@ rain , while her house standing in fl@@ ames .
at time when the great indian war@@ ri@@ or ar@@ jun@@ a had dur@@ st , he took a ar@@ bo@@ w , shot pped into the ground , and water ste@@ pped in .
and in a few hours ends and r@@ ent a car , and he comes up to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner ton@@ ight .
and this indi@@ cation that that the bu@@ b knew already inside that he &apos;s actually related to the fir@@ fire , but that he can &apos;t tell say that l@@ oud .
and this is bio@@ curious , the i just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this this one , kind of of a vol@@ k@@ sho@@ cking school in principle for molecular biology .
and based from these networks that have made the whole popular popular , just a a scene developed that which i want to portra@@ re .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes , to pli@@ ing genes , that n@@ , , frag@@ ments , so that you can make them visible .
what if you could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ move diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or elimin@@ ate the reduce of the cancer risk or stro@@ or stro@@ kes ?
and that &apos;s exactly happened we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the responsibility our memor@@ ies and the own production of our individual memor@@ ies , we &apos;ve shif@@ ted on on ex@@ ternal media .
after you first cho@@ sen a piece to play play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you first explor@@ for the back@@ back of the emergen@@ forma@@ tion of the com@@ position .
it &apos;s really a way way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal inter@@ rup@@ tions tions the un@@ inten@@ inten@@ ded je@@ do@@ od@@ ch push to to ception .
and we hope , of course that that we spread spread a similar , and then &apos;re a similar well well well , so that we can get involved in it well .
no , i actually loved love with this fish fish because because , i swe@@ ar god god , the fish was of ed ed for chicken after conversation .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government leader that gives us data , and i understand understand that , , i think we we all do .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those lo@@ cked into bo@@ xes , came from thou@@ thousand year-old old o@@ live trees .
i combin@@ ed it with my earlier love for drawing , but it was a little different different because when you using the camera , the process was was more more in in planning .
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund ds who are on choice , it &apos;s so hard decide decide you to choose that you sho@@ it it on tomorrow .
now it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you &apos;ve got enough of curi@@ osity and you put enough energy energy , you can get a way as too .
and that capacity ability to virtu@@ alize reality the reality , that people had in the pre-@@ industrial times it needed harder ter ly , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
so it &apos;s not to learn to read notes and press the respon@@ ding keys on the piano or the right place on a vi@@ o@@ lin string .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es ; it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s highest time to understand what that means .
play produ@@ ates creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about creating diversity -- diversity of diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
this whole out@@ fit , including including the jac@@ ket me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece i i contribu@@ vered in this whole week .
and you could have connected them to to government services if they had had been needed , but a one neighb@@ or is a far better and and che@@ alternative alternative to government services .
so as you can see , my a@@ desire is to develop new human computer inter@@ faces that fit fit fit to how our brains brains and bodies work .
that that kind very sad for the ha@@ cker@@ scene , because that doesn &apos;t really matter what she &apos;s actually started like this , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
now you &apos;ll ask wondering , why are the designers start working with so natural , arch@@ a@@ ical ical ur@@ of of communication communication communication and and etc , and so on .
now , when we talked a couple weeks weeks ago they they to to me that there was a pretty interesting out@@ come , and that came from this gall@@ up survey ll .
he says we should ju@@ dge people by &quot; their skin color , but by the how of their character ality , &quot; and that that , &apos;s kind kind of goes goes out about an@@ atom@@ y .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
okay , let &apos;s think that : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measure their success the health of their predat@@ ors .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after we played with them , even when they de@@ fe@@ us us .
the doctor for pr@@ at@@ ate al stic diagno@@ mother was in vac@@ ation , so my parents didn &apos;t know the man who me to bring me at all .
this is not like human@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s is chemi@@ cally un@@ differ@@ enti@@ ble from what &apos;s going to from out of the pan@@ crea@@ cre@@ as .
the same technology that the human insu@@ lin can bacteria can make viruses that can serve not only protection from yourself , but that can also for an imm@@ unity against other viruses .
and he first dre@@ w again , in both of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine imagine what sense it was in the par@@ king lot .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can catch capture , but i always want to to make it look as if she could have done that , in a picture .

i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because they come out of a series of thousands thousands of programs that have &apos;ve done done the job .
so if we look at the development of our society , repres@@ brie@@ brie@@ fly here , we &apos;re now moving from the third to the fourth fourth generation or social generation of social society .
we have a com@@ ic here . we have got high level &quot; for local understanding , knowledge connec@@ tivity , sustain@@ ability , vision and genu@@ ity .
believe it or not , it &apos;s an an experiment@@ al study with v@@ v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been engine@@ in the cells of a tab@@ bac@@ co plant .
of course the problem is that as as we start to at all the common@@ ties , we need to start to question question about why we main@@ tain certain particular visi@@ ctions .
some re@@ used to give up and cl@@ inging to bit@@ ter end , while others don longer stop it and and fall collapse in a attack of dra@@ matic passion to dra@@ matic passion .
so , that really got my interest , and we started working it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and g@@ ary said that he would offer to all the people in this audience offer offer an well-@@ pay@@ pay vac@@ vac@@ ation to the most beautiful beautiful street in the world .
unlike than in the ol@@ ated middle class sub@@ ur@@ bs , which i was &apos;t known known existence , , in foot@@ sc@@ ray there was no cla@@ cated thinking .
and then on wo@@ dy day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds , and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i can feel better again .
and even the answer to the question is no , &quot; is certainly certainly going pre@@ sha@@ rate your experience of of your child &apos;s foot@@ ball game very different than it would have been .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little understanding of it , and also a chance to educ@@ yourself yourself really well .
and you know what ? i say that , people scre@@ ell me and people say , &quot; what do you care ? let people just do whatever you want .
i came to reali@@ zed as a doctor that i took a goal that was different than the goal of of evolution -- not necessarily necessarily con@@ tradi@@ stent , just different .
today you can complete a sequence of three billion base irs of the human genome at a price of about $ 20@@ ,000 , and in the space of the the course of about a week .
some time ago ago that if they wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , they would take their budget , and put put their money to a good dri@@ driver and a good car .
in a world where plo@@ plo@@ video video video video video days every minute , only really unique and un@@ expected expected can come ke something like the videos that i mentioned .

now when you start to see the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies -- such as these plant here .
he was mu@@ g@@ wn at at two years to prison to prison to hi@@ de under her rock@@ rock mit mit because she couldn &apos;t live without him .

they were just told that were the one-@@ students , and they &apos;re the students with the note grade , and in the same way , they taught them something something and they treated them .
it was pro@@ ved and over again when this this week people came come to to me just just because of what i was wearing wearing . and i had having great conversation .
and so we knew that if wanted to see that this piece of metal metal acts quant@@ quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we we had to sna@@ ck out all the input in .
so the first : all all the trilli@@ ons atoms atoms that the piece of metal are still still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are up up and down .

and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ recogni@@ zes that people fill the system life , and if that &apos;s like that , people also also making mistakes from time to time .
and so , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that separ@@ ates a memory itself from a living vor itself . time has very impact on this story .
and you don &apos;t have -- as attac@@ attack -- you don &apos;t have have to put the use data data over a us@@ b stick , like we &apos;ve seen at stu@@ x@@ net .
and the idea of this company was to jump the phase of analog@@ y processes with visual press so etc , and start start with digital produ@@ ctions .
you have to separate two things : one , the medical fact to be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ted and for example , the social opini@@ on about whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
now i don &apos;t want you spend too much time to imagine the production , because , you &apos;re think of the stuff all time , you &apos;re not not going to listen to me .
the incredible for me is that the projects that i got the most feedback , or where i had the biggest success , , are the ones where i &apos;m directly inter@@ acting with things .
and because we care more important than our survival , the first ingre@@ di@@ ment for all of information information is a part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
to make sense that conversation , obviously course i had to know something about this remarkable belief vo@@ dou@@ n &apos;s faith , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not an cul@@ t of the black magic .
so i went buying new je@@ ans after many years of the old goods , and i said , &quot; i like to have some je@@ ans , and here &apos;s my size . &quot;
but maybe it doesn &apos;t to be full of p@@ sing if you didn &apos;t think you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence were coming from them .
we di@@ gi@@ zed almost 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced ced human genome genome , changed a changed shift shift shift from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad agen@@ cy that we talked to has com@@ ded their custom@@ ers to take finger off .
i spend most of my my time with the social we@@ ak@@ est in the social sett@@ tory and in places places where there &apos;s a awful lot of hop@@ ess@@ ess@@ .
and i was ama@@ zed to counter@@ upon resi@@ stance on resi@@ stance to what is ultimately the most most effective effective in in health care in human history .
a country has already ered to provide its su@@ pre@@ me court , in court for complete appe@@ ance of the legal system there .
and it &apos;s ust when you see in in it@@ al@@ y that people in the high ar@@ w w throw throw of col@@ ke can sis of the car , it .
we want to be for society , we want to be good for economics , , but when it comes about the environment , it &apos;s highest not not to be there , right ?
they ni@@ vel@@ ated the play field and they decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , the simil@@ ali@@ ties were coun@@ ting , not the differences . . and that was very radical .
and we &apos;re really with a choice : do we want to in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ chro@@ matic world of the mon@@ ot@@ ony , or in a poly@@ chro@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
what they showed back was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and they got it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 200 years for us was practical .
and then my friends who make little indepen@@ dent@@ ism movies , &quot; well how should we compe@@ with with these big giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
do you remember car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger@@ ger ec@@ vehicle 199@@ 199@@ , when it passed to saturn , it went back to the earth ?
and now , if you want want to do anything , if you want to test something something and especially if you want to make happy happy , you can to practice this coura@@ ge to lies .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked been years for non-@@ rup@@ rup@@ , , sometimes sometimes we been to sea la@@ for two to three months .
i &apos;m saying that i wra@@ close my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ ev@@ a , or out of out , , and that &apos;s a lie .
and maybe we manage to see see vulner@@ ability as something natural , stent and useful useful and make feel feel as ressed as l@@ bled by their pres@@ ence .
and i sent a few facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter news sages , and and i gave people the opportunity to res@@ up the nam@@ &apos; rights to my ted@@ talk 2011 .
the reason why i felt bad was because , with all these available , my expec@@ tations of what a good few je@@ ans , went up .
when your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t boo@@ al all credit for you , everybody knew knew you had this bo@@ less geni@@ us that helped you you .
a jo@@ id -- if you make it full full with water , you &apos;ll enough enough pressure , i i think , about about 40 to six bar bar on it .
and many discus@@ sions that i had in the last six years were kind similar like the discussion that i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years on the subject of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to ada@@ pt to to ris@@ ing challenges , through greater creativity and expres@@ of stron@@ forced co@@ operation .
his job is to create the conditions that sted less than a billi@@ on@@ th th second after the beginning of the universe -- and that up up to 600 million times in a second .
that means we &apos;re pro@@ j@@ ating our vision , before we see it , put put that back back into our your se@@ appar@@ device , and to , , okay .
there are a series of people who have more &quot; u@@ h-@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than other others , and the the worst est ones are fresh b@@ w@@ l gradu@@ ates .
we &apos;ll have a process process that usually takes probably 100,000 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it to a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
and as the woman who wanted to me as an adult wanted to met me , she turned to turning into a box box full of ash , and was placed into my hands .
one day -- this &apos;s an actual report -- this came into in : &quot; su@@ yl@@ ac@@ rat in my tr@@ ash ton@@ ne . can &apos;t &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
it says , &quot; this plane consi@@ made of hundreds of of little bits working together to make your flight sa@@ fer . &apos; &apos; &apos;t &apos;t that make you more confi@@ able ? &quot;
eventually , this older black man came with a very concerned face ial look came into the court room and sat right behind me almost in the defen@@ se bank .
it &apos;s about how you face people into inter@@ active media , that they can use this inter@@ active media , and so that they can create a most gra@@ satis@@ fying experience .
and i personally that it &apos;s more easier to create a place than find a place , because you you don &apos;t have to go to com@@ com@@ promise with the ideas of your ideas in your head .
so an organis@@ m could learn to learn learn not not eat eat particular fru@@ it because it ta@@ ad@@ ad@@ , and made it sick sick , the last time he e@@ aten it .
to nine people that we &apos;ve ecu@@ ecu@@ ted is one that we consider to be inno@@ cent , who has been de@@ char@@ ted and rele@@ rele@@ out from the death cell .
when i think about creating flow , i don don mean mean a full of lux@@ ury ury for everyone on this planet ; i &apos;m about about creating create a life of possibilities .
i was back years 10 when i went on one one of his ses again , and i played the last ones of the four bal@@ bal@@ ps of ch@@ op@@ in , a later &apos;s work .
but the measu@@ re@@ bar came back fully , and and the people in my company told me that , you , , , we we &apos;t be able to be able to do that .
and sometimes a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is all it takes to take us from a &quot; u@@ oh oh &quot; &quot; to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; &quot; moment .
i mean it can sound strange to think that one thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
and we have that that &apos;s not not connected , but that &apos;s yes , i think , has done relatively well , and people are quite convinced of this .
so there i stood again with a team team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , we turned &quot; &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology que that didn &apos;t yet had before .
we have to have these conversation , and we need to think , but we go go into the machine machine and go go into the future , we &apos;re &apos;re going going to to gla@@ happy to have done that .
the head of the gress came to the stage and he said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , i thank you very much for your talk , but but maybe we could look see the ted@@ talk .
so i decided one day to visit the metal je@@ der , and i asked the director , &quot; is does this model work that you really offer people all all these possibilities ? &quot;
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ load and 1.@@ 3 percent percent of the employees in the health care .
we want to encoura@@ the world of ators , the inv@@ ent@@ ors , the contribu@@ ators , because it to ging this world we live in , this inter@@ active world , bel@@ gs to us .
we &apos;ll turn on on , and expect to collect the first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue continue our journey to try figure out what are the building blocks are in the universe .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n that you bu@@ ried without all the intri@@ ties .
how you can increase happiness is very depen@@ ding on how they think , and whether you think about memor@@ ing self , or whether you think of the life life itself .
but lat@@ est dna evidence show that e@@ tr@@ us@@ cians , who later formed the ro@@ man real@@ m , demon@@ showing exactly the same dna as the the old ly@@ di@@ ans .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks progra@@ mming , nu@@ del@@ par@@ ties and and per@@ through ni@@ ghts , tony dre@@ w again for the first time again after seven years .
well , there are distribu@@ ed ands and eight br@@ ands , these things that come come and go , but but a all@@ ed , min@@ ght-@@ ful brand is a pretty strong thing .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood after my talk , and said , &quot; you know know , it &apos;s deeply dist@@ ur@@ bing bing to hear you talk like this . &quot;
it &apos;s still a a very happy conc@@ ert if i can have the experience to experience the piece i &apos;ve so long in in v@@ ance , like re@@ new .
but the lo@@ gic of illusion en@@ ables us to pre@@ tend though the first sentence was fal@@ wrong at the first , as as you you have have to course have to accept the opposite without without evidence .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually for most of all , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms of our cells are the same .
in a country that &apos;s just a significant crisis behind it , was ele@@ in con@@ gress for this sum@@ change at 1@@ 24 to a 24 .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very very ex@@ clu@@ sive gro@@ cer@@ y store at at at that he was really ex@@ clu@@ sive .
but these app@@ s are like digital memor@@ ies that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , who pay ta@@ xes and recei@@ ving services .
and i &apos;d happy to tell you my worst mistakes was only only in the first five years had happened happened to a many of my colleagues , but it &apos;s total non@@ sense .
many of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that and that we come back and all the images on the walls would have wei@@ ted gra@@ ff@@ iti tis .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now : building off the co@@ coal plants , because we otherwise &apos;t &apos;t , or ga@@ stur@@ bin@@ es because because it &apos;s &apos;t .
to bur@@ r@@ elle , was in janu@@ ary , and since since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this film .
but this kee@@ me wake at night -- one of the things things that wake me wake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as as ately as never before .
we actually start from a new : we di@@ gi@@ ti@@ biology biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new new phase of biology by designing designing designing and build new lives .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re in elimin@@ rid the dan@@ gers that others first create when they &apos;re putting fire .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , , a sequence of sound , and we make something something very complicated in the heads of the other .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for keeping the people we love in from fortun@@ te stro@@ kes but but also pre@@ p@@ ing them to to get clear with it .
and it turns out that if you can able something to feel cre@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool , so that you can to get people to save more .
i told my wife , whenever whenever a person uses a moral justi@@ fication use the dic@@ tion@@ ary because , we should try to replace it with the dic@@ ary even .
i love to find a different kind , different color@@ , crazy crazy out@@ fit out@@ every , and and also to photograph@@ ing and blog@@ photograph and blog blog recently .
so that was a problem for these re@@ ac@@ tors is what we fill in our ours , and therefore the waste volu@@ me is dra@@ matically redu@@ duced during this process .
now , in eg@@ y@@ pt , the sur@@ pris@@ ants in apri@@ l , 2011 lo@@ set the head@@ quar@@ ters of eg@@ yp@@ yp@@ ti@@ an an intelligence police , and they found found a lot of recor@@ ds .
how about about to to the op@@ pres@@ sed everywhere you are , give a voice , in order to point attention to yourself and to create change , for the very first time ?
i think that molecular biology is generally now , so , in general , biot@@ biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count to that , syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
they didn &apos;t count because he sta@@ ined with a memory ; the memory memory was ru@@ ined , and the memor@@ memory was all all he got to hold .
and finally , satur@@ day : a own unique unique , personal personal style is a great way way to tell the world world something about one without having to have say a word word .
i came to ted ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ pen@@ re of the universe universe is a exten@@ ward , but that it goes to justice .
and every year we ask the students , companies , , products and services that who , a , , a , , positive positive of the lives of mil@@ of of mil@@ of ds of people .
a process that has -- as anyone knows has ever tried to do something -- so in in other words , actually everyone here -- doesn &apos;t always feel sensi@@ ble .
and our european inter@@ und network is basically just entirely of oud ro@@ tat@@ ing mass of large power plants , where the wave is revol@@ turning all all over europe .
and something interesting thing happened . what fascin@@ ated by jac@@ jac@@ cou@@ ste@@ au &apos;s sen@@ shows shows was the thought of a world that we completely un@@ known world here on earth earth .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you heard about , the stron@@ gest psycho@@ psycho@@ active im@@ ate from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sh@@ am@@ an .
even transl@@ ating from ger@@ man getting into english english can require much more knowledge , at time you &apos;re when when it &apos;s about di@@ ting , or even about poetry .
i can sound the sound sound today that the ach has had had on the modern wing , which a b@@ aro@@ ck@@ c@@ em@@ can can &apos;t .
but also too . because it turns out that by using using games all all of play , we actually change what we &apos;re capable to as humans .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i would take several several months to plan them , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
so these are just some of the cli@@ ps i colle@@ cted over the last six six months but it could also have been been the last six days . or the last six years .
and i talked to me that if i double my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction and never never ted a mistake , the voice could give up .
the reason is that everything to be better when everything was worse , when everything was worse , it was possible for the people to have experiences experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
and i &apos;ve argue that we may be in creating a new form of cam@@ br@@ brian explosion where there could be massive massive new of of ar@@ being based on this digital design .
so here it go here . and for those who weren &apos;t back then , the l@@ l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment that &apos;d ever done done it -- 27 miles a diam@@ .
because it makes as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about when talking was the the absolutely cing cap@@ ful@@ ness of the creative process .
i said to oud , &quot; listen your thing , and i both both know , if this book is not brilliant , you know , it &apos;s not going it &apos;s my my fau@@ lt , right ?
and there we struggle ourselves on the media cam@@ pus , like display virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ . lab , and we &apos;re actually actually actually do it all the time .
we came to talk about music , and and a few days later i got an email saying saying na@@ than@@ iel was interested in interest in me .
we had all then then . if we read a book as a children we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ , and we inje@@ them down on the can@@ v@@ as in our heads .
and very often i &apos;ve worked with inter@@ sexual people whose their sex is at@@ yp@@ ical -- which are people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and if you already heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ is complex and high-@@ tech , , let me tell you you , the user data is actually a science for itself .
are they reli@@ , stable stable stable , family , sec@@ , , born , hol@@ red , , , , such like d@@ d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
and because the government takes its power out us us -- remember you , &quot; &quot; us the people ? &quot; &quot; -- how we think about it is going to affect how this change happens .
how would it feel living living in a world where the ger@@ man man state built people , especially if there were un@@ propor@@ lot of je@@ ws .
at this point and you lau@@ gh , see how important this lie is , and how much time it takes to take to en@@ experience something that artists can tell us very well .
what that means is that if you met someone , and you would tell you &quot; oh , your father father is two-@@ two-@@ meter foot man , how much would you know about their hei@@ ght ?
so an ap@@ p that is written a few days , and then spread spread by sel@@ , is a kind of a shot from the bu@@ g to the institution of the government .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives enormous confidence in our future is the fact fact we today have more power than individuals to to front face the great challenges of our planet .
we have now from our ver@@ from around the world , a ab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to to believe that these are the design components of the future .
you st@@ looking on the hori@@ zon , which is a miles away , and all you can see are f@@ loo@@ ded chan@@ n@@ els and those den@@ se , l@@ ush mar@@ .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
but then happened another , very interesting step where things things became completely different , and that these cells began to communicate and exchange information information so that they create of communities of cells .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine world where i feel a some more comfortable or or maybe a little little less comfortable after i talked to you about it .
basically , you get every round every si@@ ability chance random random co@@ ted letters , and as you &apos;re trying to try to form words , they &apos;re being te@@ sted over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
now , i was phone with a few people in the company . nobody could &apos;t give me a der@@ ly answer , until finally i i phones with the sen@@ ior bi@@ ist .
if i tell you that somebody or@@ dered their life at eight on scale of 10 , you have a lot of inse@@ curity about how happy they is with their living himself .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that lets us explore and and interact , and the un@@ un@@ expected of of that that we form , is the real nutri@@ ent ground of creativity .
one of the areas where we see it for iel , in our culture today today in in the united states , is the fighting ghts about the beginning and the end of life .
in the last 100 years , average expec@@ tan@@ cy has dou@@ bled , the average inf@@ inf@@ inf@@ inf@@ average income of the world population has tri@@ pl@@ bled .
90 percent of the big fish , ones we love , the tun@@ a , the hot bu@@ tte , the sal@@ mon mon , , heavy d@@ fish fish they they been broken sed .
we can take a step further and re@@ range the data data and and see that cular disease and cancer are the usual sus@@ pi@@ cts , but not for everyone .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion dollars a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
my wife , children and i moved moved to the garage and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cri@@ ci@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts sts have taken over our house .
unlike unlike with one-@@ tial conversation of the 20th 20th century , part of the community is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by by dis@@ se@@ ading it or make something new of it .
in each step we produced these pieces in the sur@@ plus so we could sequence it , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
and if course do it , we succe@@ it for for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz , and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places places and a world of wonder@@ cles that we we never have able to imag@@ ined .
if we look one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king king , he off@@ us his &quot; i talk a dream , &quot; a kind of a solution .
and so i consider myself one of the individuals , with the other experiment@@ al quant@@ physi@@ physi@@ sts , who need a good propor@@ tion of gic gic to assem@@ together the complex ideas .
i got a traffic ti@@ cket because i didn &apos;t driving on the bi@@ ke way way , but often there are dis@@ ab@@ that don &apos;t &apos;t let you drive on the bi@@ ke ride .
maybe i wanted to be successful and so able to take responsibility that i was hand@@ ated and so i would would be able able to to care for my patients without without having to to cont@@ contact him .
just as you knew in the village who &apos;s got what to whom with with when , what &apos;s going to to now about this aug@@ sion sion of ourselves through these mobile end devices at the global scale .
and since there were video video or that over@@ loo@@ ration ration computer@@ gener@@ ated movies nor the whole ima@@ ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ aling , electricity gener@@ ating things that are very low-@@ cost , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and and then 20 years to use .
and imagine , i negoti@@ when i was a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . and trying to stop stop these exercise , naturally course without success .
but it could also be used to get people from their cha@@ irs and get them to play some kind of game , help better control their health .
now , what hear hear all too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want huge fields fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
many journ@@ alists called me to the question , &quot; what are you going to do that tells us if ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ men@@ ya is female or a male ? &quot;
and intui@@ tive user bility not just since apple is an fundamental economic factor , a very element@@ ary success factor , if i wanted to just just technology technologi@@ technology devices to people .
that means the interpre@@ t to trans@@ late these ex@@ ct fig@@ es of not@@ not@@ al language into another different , which is audi@@ ble ble , cre@@ te , non@@ verb@@ al music language .
and so we decided to build a a hal@@ lin a in where we can kind of map map the electrical ics of the island at scale one to three three very carefully .
until far , discussion sions always tried , these insu@@ ans , they make themselves au@@ tar@@ k , they have a own web web , and , it &apos;s nothing to to do to do with our da@@ ge .
i sold to the film as &quot; &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship , &quot; and it became a love of of epi@@ epi@@ c expression , a passion@@ passionate film .
the other note says whether we use the zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , invented the cu@@ be , and they posed a national strategy , and on one day you would to eat . the next day you would play .
i &apos;m a mou@@ er . to work , i have to stand up and at the same time at at every time , get me , and really tor@@ through through really aw@@ k@@ ward .
you have to imagine that that if you &apos;re something to the classi@@ c so@@ f@@ ware , you takes five hours and with this new kind of of natural software , only take you for an hour .
it depen@@ ds a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ , and it acts as as if the opposite of the first sentence has already already pro@@ ven ted and pres@@ sum@@ ed .
and yet burning coal coal is one of the main main reasons for global warming , the remark@@ ably clean coal coal that you see here changes everything .
so means instead of remem@@ ourselves individu@@ , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , well-@@ common , wi@@ wi@@ ad patterns patterns of memor@@ ies that which we can hang our personal memor@@ ies .
of course , the chance of random in@@ struc@@ tions is very small that they by by chance they provide numbers , so so i probably none of the in@@ struc@@ tions will actually do this .
and then we cut up d.@@ v@@ .@@ d bren@@ ner , and put the the burning to the las@@ er , and then we tried to focus on this camera there .
and if you want to go 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ ables energy , so energy energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn the dies@@ el .
they should talk about this innovation strategy , and they &apos;d be sho@@ cked of the ridi@@ cul@@ ously ly small money that are being spent on for these innovative approach .
if you also play , some an@@ an@@ ds here , the eyes zo@@ wn up and the mouth are are a indi@@ cation of optimis@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws reve@@ showing surprise .
the food that was lo@@ vely coo@@ or or a a ok , you eat have to to e@@ aten and don &apos;t just just che@@ at or tra@@ ting re@@ reci@@ pes .
several weeks later , the fire@@ man got a letter from the hou@@ hol@@ hol@@ , , than@@ ked themselves for the da@@ ve effort to to save their house .
i recently a survey ll with over 2@@ ,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that , by conclu@@ , , typical typical american does on a day is is 70 .
then the scale of se@@ man@@ tic cros@@ connec@@ connection and the ab@@ und@@ ance that make from it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
and i &apos;ve learned that the deep sea world , even in the s@@ hal@@ low oceans is so so rich in fascinating life , as we can har@@ har@@ ely imagine .
they also have such arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct with biological materials , and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics car@@ es , and they combin@@ bine that that in a very remote way .
i &apos;m going to have more life than today , and therefore will have on my pal@@ ette of music , have many more color color an@@ an@@ ces of emotions emotions emotions sensi@@ emotion than today today .
it looks like this , who has no freedom , can also not for his actions and cla@@ ims can can to be be brought to responsibility , and that &apos;s therefore so he un@@ un@@ accep@@ table .
but in the mi@@ 199@@ 0s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ at@@ ary and ter design -- which we actually started the company -- we started too slowly .
well , that &apos;s good , except paul walking around and talks about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how how valuable they are , and that that people should just stop jam@@ ining .
if people took this fin@@ dings seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything up@@ its head , everything we believe , , for example , in in terms of ta@@ x policy and so on .
so when i started talking to the companies and and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no no , we want you to tell a story .
we study if we can use saved carbon , that could easily be brought to manufacturing jobs , , consu@@ conver@@ t the co2 into prop@@ fu@@ gen to drive this process .
we should call them what it is , a ad ad in intri@@ acy , a craft craft that quickly quickly ces e@@ environmental capital that en@@ ables just this production .
now if we continue and care after age , say 40 years or yo@@ unger unger , that dents is actually the main cause that people should worry about .
it &apos;s the life self that the doctor pres@@ ses -- you know when the doctor says , &quot; now it it hurt hurt if i press you here ? &quot;
and if you engineer the speed of this ro@@ tor , you &apos;re actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and , , , , to explo@@ de the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the ty cl@@ c of the engine , the cla@@ pping pping every wave wave on the bu@@ g , the l@@ wide and empty hori@@ zon .
one drop in the ocean , i know but i take it , and and you should do too , because this love story , like roman@@ roman@@ tic , is also in@@ umin@@ ating .
everybody thinks that i walked away between ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; &quot; had had been br@@ ed the na@@ il on a to@@ we@@ l on a beach .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented various top@@ issues that these ce@@ o was dealing with , and how much time they spent making making decisions that related related with the issues .
it was sed in the cell and and realized the other chromo@@ some as di@@ ge@@ sted as material material and so then at end end end up with one cell with a new chromo@@ some .
so so you also realize that that there &apos;s a change there and it just from that defen@@ vation to to yes , to the idea sion , a hundred percent percent rene@@ rene@@ w@@ able true .
you get into this cap@@ su@@ le , you flo@@ flo@@ down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment , there is no hope hope for res@@ cu@@ e , if you you &apos;t &apos;t back it yourself .
the second event is a variety of experience experience and memory : basically it between being happy in his life and happy about life or happy with his life .
well , i hope that you to agree that players are human human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have very meaning for change .
and by the way , we travel and circu@@ late and mix mix us so much that they can no longer longer longer to say that isol@@ ation is necessary necessary , for evolution to stay continue .
so gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sexu@@ als are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender gender -- in some sense , they can be distribu@@ spread across the band@@ wid@@ th .
i think that the remarkable thing about the recent of recent years , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve moved from a physical to a digital world .
so if you take the system the way i was taught , and you out all the mis@@ wed health experts , there &apos;s ends up up one left left .
and because they work much harder than we do , and because they only live three to six months , they dis@@ respond in their weight , in their energy consumption , something 3@@ 30 billion people .
many argument against that . fish far@@ plants pollu@@ the environment , most most of them anyway , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , you take tun@@ a , tun@@ tun@@ a . a very dis@@ dis@@ advantage .
and in my view the scientific way to try things , see if it works , change it it if it doesn &apos;t it is one one of the greatest achie@@ achie@@ v@@ ements in humanity .
but i think in this frame here here and inten@@ tent to make something out of an de@@ ception , i &apos;m going to leave the need@@ le in there and and go go off the stage .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient gre@@ gre@@ ek histor@@ ian ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you may know about this story , the story of how and and why games were invented .
but for over two weeks , we program , we went to the beach building in ven@@ ice , my my kids were involved in , my dog as well , and we created this here .
but it was a pretty abstra@@ discussion , at one point when there was a break , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said said , &quot; paul , we might be able to at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
now , if you calcu@@ it , people bought six times likely buy a glass mar@@ mel@@ ate if you had six to the choice than than if you had 24 on the choice .
when this device sequence a r@@ or dna dna virus that &apos;s not known , , it calls the the of of health , and it pre@@ pre@@ pre@@ v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic before its out@@ break break .
these are two different un@@ its , the un@@ vid self and memor@@ ing itself , and changing them of changing them is part of the break@@ ment@@ ation of the concept of happiness .
now please run all these random random in@@ struc@@ tions , , run all the programs programs and and then by end , those of of whom who are next next to my pres@@ va@@ ance . &quot;
by by sending her home , i mis@@ mis@@ sed a quie@@ voice voice in me trying trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . do &apos;t . &quot;
and after a very short , it had lost all characteri@@ stics of the species and completely conver@@ ted completely into a new species based on the new software software we &apos;ve put put into the cell .
i learned a lot about science . but now i you certainly think think a director director to lead as too , be a leader like a ship cap@@ p or something .
and as far isol@@ ation comes , if we col@@ oni@@ zing dist@@ as ant planet , there be isol@@ isol@@ ation and the changes of the environment , that evolution produce in a natural fashion .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up with the internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just just have to build the proper@@ right .
and we predict that in in 10 years , the rates of tion of civil vi@@ c honor rights will be as high as before rele@@ passed the ele@@ ction law .
we only only two two years us and and already now , through phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing ing in the world many more ur@@ ani@@ um into into the than than used in all nuclear facili@@ plants .
because our system also has pri@@ ces is because we &apos;re doing 20 percent with dies@@ el el and we also hit price incre@@ ases to the other things .
and finally , i think , it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have gone to these dist@@ ant a@@ es of the earth to to realize they &apos;re not not away at all .
and in this community you realize that the most important is the obser@@ vation you have front of each other because you &apos;ve achie@@ ed a task that you can &apos;t explain anyone else .
and i was used because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing is to present your product as as many people as possible , let it see as many people as possible .
this tri@@ , the co@@ fan , have 17 vari@@ of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , that you all recognize at very distance stances in the forest that that , , to , , to our , , appear to appear as a way .
we see many , many gi@@ gab@@ tes of digital photos here that that can actually bring and and listen hold se@@ am@@ less@@ less@@ ously , , in any way , re@@ ar@@ range gate .
and my love of science fi@@ seemed to stick in my environment , because at that , in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon moon explor@@ studying the deep sea .
these are a people that is not cogni@@ tively between the colors blue and green green , because the hea@@ cele@@ al al is is is zed to to the forest forest the upon whom people dep@@ dent upon .
suppose you have a blind dness , and you you &apos;re refer@@ ted to to an surgery that whose average performance is 400 in terms of blin@@ dar@@ on@@ ia .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful cho@@ irs of &quot; shu@@ ty eye , &quot; and here and there said , &quot; &quot; asi@@ ans , go home . &quot;
i &apos;ve now gone enough from my conven@@ comfort room to know that that , yes , the world is collap@@ , , but not as , how you fear it .
it just happened is that there were self-@@ manage alterna@@ tives , and one one of them just sat in cru@@ z@@ berg the ur@@ ty@@ ard , where you were gu@@ cting the evil .
for the memor@@ der itself a two-@@ wee@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the week week vac@@ vac@@ ation , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies .
my call to to everybody who flying today is : imagine the same happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it ; ; and how would you change ?
i think &quot; fresh &quot; &quot; is great word that really really makes categ@@ ory to a positive positive , rather to , &quot; f@@ f@@ sm@@ smell and hu@@ mi@@ ty . &quot;
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an th@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , it should to , , a birthday shel@@ ker , a saving assi@@ assi@@ stant ?
last month month i had the pleasure announ@@ cing the qu@@ al@@ comm@@ foundation , what &apos;s called the $ $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
and the women came with their stories about men who &apos;t make the change , an@@ an@@ gry and un@@ flexi@@ ble , and gener@@ ded children tra@@ pped between two worl@@ ds .
there could be a real , beautiful , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom tom and the strange , ou@@ ternal thing that was not quite tom .
i bu@@ yed my father until he finally found a di@@ school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
because , you know , i imagine a creatures for which we could then make a visual effect for but i couldn &apos;t &apos;t imagine imagine what i was going to see outside of the window .
so in fact is the white ball doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t work as well a cap@@ su@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t work as well as the need@@ le .
and second , we as a species species con@@ ra@@ tioned our environment environment so way that we &apos;ve gotten able to ada@@ ada@@ pt to us just as as we ada@@ pt to them .
it &apos;s never happened before in the history of technology development , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive sive growth through which the scale order is exponenti@@ ally increasing every several years every few years .
that doesn &apos;t mean you probably probably to go home home four hours , but your emplo@@ yer or somebody is already to to of how how to do them accor@@ with the four hours .
of course , the the stories i i looking was was from the science fi@@ ction called &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
now , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t really think clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about about life , and if we actually live .
ur@@ ability optimis@@ m is the desire desire to immediately do something , ma@@ master a hur@@ elt , along with belie@@ belief that we have a green@@ unded hope for success .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound profound and od@@ strange of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
we have very hard to talk about race , and i think that that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing willing to get to the process of truth truth and re@@ con@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
and i went through the same tor@@ ture of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , felt liber@@ free , went went quie@@ ently to work work until it happened again and again and again and again .
she came from a man an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ path@@ ic ra@@ u , hom@@ hom@@ eless , who played on a vi@@ o@@ lin lin , who who only only had two sa@@ ings .
i let some people the number of books that were published published &quot; happiness in the ti@@ tle in the last five years , and they po@@ up up about about 40 , and there more more , and there &apos;s more lot more .
they were felt that people who had had political power should have this political power , because of the her@@ her@@ ited blood line from the grand@@ father to to son to son and so on .
and this was , for us , exciting , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers designers , always start of think about about how people are use the things that we design .
arm@@ strong twi@@ ed about us and then , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me magazine taught us us as as one of the 50 top best inno@@ inven@@ tions , was really great .
there &apos;s a enormous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption medi@@ cations for people like you and me that that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
they believed that creativity was a kind di@@ di@@ ine di@@ tat@@ spirit spirit that comes from a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source to to to people -- -- for for un@@ explan@@ ined , un@@ known reasons .
and then then in in in the 8@@ 0s 0s to ber@@ lin , because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ able energy , and that didn &apos;t &apos;t it it in kar@@ l@@ ju@@ a .
not only from dar@@ darwin &apos;s work we know that man &apos;s ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ our@@ is determin@@ ed by the struggle of the human spirit , to conver@@ themselves through confli@@ cts .
and in this scen@@ o , imagine that in a case the sper@@ m has an y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m hit@@ hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ cell .
and so i had develop this new intuition that it looks as all all the objects in the ev@@ was actually actually just quant@@ ant objects objects that are made together in a small room .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people around the country who standing up and writing government app@@ s every day in their own communities .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic that would bring us from from a world of sta@@ tic , stac@@ stac@@ king building blocks blocks to a world in which everything was inter@@ inter@@ active .
and the most est of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom and master master the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make tly make these decisions ?
now in our town where where volunte@@ ers suppor@@ a highly quali@@ quali@@ professional fi@@ fi@@ department , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early early be in the burn place order to with me .
but it &apos;s usually to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty and your brea@@ sts grow up and develop , but they doesn &apos;t going to get your period , until somebody arri@@ ds to it that there &apos;s something different .
and you do some few tests and you find that instead of bu@@ gs gs and u@@ ter@@ us , you actually actually sti@@ cles in them , and that you has a y y chromo@@ some .
no longer a building that would open to let it in , but a building that was still brea@@ ks and holes in the water , and you had to jump jump now without getting we@@ t .
i had to make it wasn &apos;t un@@ free , and it was my job me to learn that the story continu@@ constantly tried to cr@@ ush us , but we were it it .
and we think to think that this is one of the main problems why all of us -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects are are missing , because we stopped stopped listening .
now , with all our digital devices that seven days a week , 24 hours a day give us all these negative news , it &apos;s not not mira@@ cle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
and we start starting by taking the waste that &apos;s exists , that &apos;s in these hot pon@@ ins or dry tan@@ ks in the re@@ ac@@ tors , and know so that that &apos;s our starting fuel .
it dem@@ ands that we all focus on our senses , and that we use use use our thinking , like our emotions and we do do , in the challenge that lies before us .
while i do that , i &apos;ll also to you some of the lessons that i i that , believe it or not , i learned from these ad@@ vent@@ ers to wear nothing new .
but tomorrow it can to face face the challenges coming -- -- think of climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how how can we then move move from the digital world to physical ?
the dri@@ vers for im@@ moving objects are not humans , but the light that sh@@ ars on them , and the wind that blo@@ ws over to them , and and the heat of the space .
most of you are digital photographs from a camera , but this is a scan for example library from the gress library , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ els .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3@@ foot foot tru@@ ck that &apos;s be under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can can kind ee@@ ee@@ it something below it .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good cause ; i look looking quite unique , and it makes making sh@@ opp@@ ing to my own personal go@@ ch@@ p .
and when they play with their particles they find all sorts of weird things -- like that you &apos;re directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places .
the interesting interesting here that this slide , like so many others that we often often often lot in our field , are a kind of right on a mi@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
now , of all people i met , the kog@@ i from from si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia a , were the most extraordinary .
and what exactly about about the creative pris@@ urs , that they make us inse@@ cure about the other state state of mind -- in a way that other other jobs don &apos;t ?
all you have to do is look at bit@@ ter death numbers of really really great minds just in the 20th century , who who young young and often died from their own hand .
right now we grow cor@@ n , and we lose between 11 and 30 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of tons per he@@ ct@@ are , or do the square meter .
it &apos;s for la@@ y@@ ies thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as as m@@ ess as everyone else .
i would write it this : not the most powerful of its species , , and not not the most intelligent of its species , but the one who can best best ada@@ pt to change .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to at a ted@@ talk at the the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going something something something a little different .
in fact is , obje@@ ctive tively , at the first had more information than the second time , but i &apos;d would d@@ car to guess guess that they felt it real for the second time .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ ts that had an growth growth opti@@ opti@@ mal com@@ put grew than than others , and integr@@ ated more and more more chemicals from the outside , and divi@@ ded faster .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma : if our goal is the ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the well-@@ being of our citizens , it &apos;s mostly because because because through the ma@@ mi@@ mi@@ zing of the freedom of the individual .
we have secon@@ - and third and third fuel that will come out relatively soon that will have much higher sugar sug@@ den@@ ties , like oc@@ tan@@ tan or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
the second thing is that we since since these arch@@ a@@ ical models are being able to speak very , very ally , even though we &apos;re today using a co@@ as a co@@ di@@ fied language .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that conne@@ associated the autis@@ m epidemic with the meas@@ r , the mu@@ mp@@ s , and the p@@ ro@@ ine v@@ acc@@ ine .
if we don &apos;t do , if we continue on as we usual , we feel gu@@ il@@ ty of something we , i don &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ of , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
if you look at the history of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it clear that many of them were very very interested in science and they were interested in in a concept of a natur@@ alist world .
it will take a while and people will disc@@ uss whether they want to explore experience happiness or whether they want want to explore life al@@ view , so so we &apos;ve to have to lead this discussion pretty soon .
so think if it it not only possible to choose gender &apos;s your child , but also do on your body genetic genetic adap@@ tations that would he@@ al and b@@ prevent disease .
fresh water , ancient land land rain@@ rain@@ fore@@ sts oil , gas : they disappe@@ , soon soon , and and if we don &apos;t inno@@ v@@ ate out of this chaos chaos , we also ar too .
we start when we we the leadership voice in two sequen@@ sequen@@ cing se@@ able , and we range range it in a a , exp@@ it , and we add a little bit more a little more to the voice .
and my friends who make big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies , say that the reason why their films are so successful is because the brand part@@ ners they have .
but then it could could be a 3d 3d cloud of screen points that you can go towards and where you move through through , that you can look at from many , many direc@@ tions .
well , after ele@@ sen government , i realize that that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ac@@ ories ories that cover most with it , time zin@@ es &quot; people of the year . &quot;
now if we manage to com@@ com@@ te the systems that control revol@@ sts and the val@@ ves , then we can actually do caus@@ a a lot lot of problems with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
if you see who we were how life life ped us , we can now see that the men who might have have come into our lives , would have come us into the cros@@ der .
and fortunately there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds hundreds who , just when their approach@@ es are working , the the mot@@ ing for their pil@@ pil@@ , , can help for it .
when i was 14 or 15 , my brother my brother came home and brought this six@@ pack be@@ er with and and grab@@ grab@@ bed my sister sister and me , and went walked us and walked with us in the forest .
so we set it to the the top line to spend a significant amount of money to get a ad action on the way to get the truth about coal .
so these communities began to continue on that the level on which evolution occur@@ red was no longer the single cell cell but was the entire cell community , which we call organis@@ m .
we need to deal with the in@@ stopp@@ ate separ@@ ation from death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance dance and and create art .
i have a company doing design and anima@@ tions , gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably , a complex part of what we we ad@@ mi@@ re and and pay attention in the art world .
the benefit is trans@@ into the gra@@ y box box , damage damage the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and ir@@ ani@@ an energy program is del@@ del@@ ing -- -- mission -- per@@ mission .
the exciting phase came when took took piece of organized chemical and we put it into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and vi@@ ral particles .
so very , very exciting processes that then in in , yes , it &apos;s not really y , but here just just in in this ink mass are running accor@@ proper@@ ingly .
so , if we see that we can trans@@ exi@@ sting action models from one to something else , the metaphor , then i can explo@@ it as a designers .
and the wind plant plant or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system , or a system , which can only store here in small quanti@@ ties .
and that &apos;s kind of our our vision of a sensi@@ ble energy , and i &apos;m also cra@@ d@@ d@@ to-@@ cra@@ d@@ le also gr@@ ate@@ ful that they were said to use solar energy .
&quot; don , i said , &quot; just just to have facts cor@@ right , you are famous for to grow out so far in the ocean , that you don &apos;t pollu@@ amin@@ the environment . &quot;
the auth@@ or of the story@@ telling animal , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ go@@ ch@@ all , we &apos;re still ban@@ cting each every year year and thousand and a a hours with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
but to me in the active active media is the most amazing about me is that by evil , we monit@@ ch@@ ed in our biological memory memory , the the ability to think non@@ lin@@ ear .
and funny z@@ ingly , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s was developed at b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , which is ab@@ b b , and was then then ex@@ cen@@ sor@@ ed to to the japanese .
so i suggest pose if you feel l@@ d , you look away for the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;m &apos;m going to make the first hot part in the back .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a person@@ ality was something that would be machine read@@ read@@ able in the future -- could be be visible visible using f@@ mr@@ i ?
first , we ti@@ the do@@ ors to in@@ sur@@ es , and we actually at for speed get a device that it can communicate with -- -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
two years later i had service at the emergen@@ cy station in a commun@@ hospital north north of tor@@ onto , and i was vie@@ wed a 25@@ -@@ -year-old old man with travel@@ ed ra@@ p .
and we b@@ around the corner and we had us the most incredible look , thousands and thousands of , p@@ ink ink fl@@ gos , a literally literally p@@ ink car@@ pe@@ pet so far as far as the eye .
but i bet bet playing with with the ground res@@ wave taught a very valuable lesson , which is the big things don &apos;t just leave you over , and and that they stay at one place .
how big a battery battery have to be to make you make an island to about 20 , 30 , 40 , five , maybe even seven percent rene@@ w@@ able ?
and we just trying to realize that you can break break the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run run capacity capacity , , by you also also putting electro@@ electrical stor@@ es into the net .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t even work on in@@ sur@@ ance because you &apos;s be going wrong , wrong , so you &apos;re going going you you going going going &apos;re going going going going because because you know you &apos;re going to be you to heart surgery .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti my former home home at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i investi@@ looking in my graduate graduate , , why we &apos;re better in games than in real life .
play is a trans@@ duc@@ ler and it can take many forms forms which some are a little bit quie@@ quie@@ ur@@ , , more imag@@ in@@ ful , curi@@ curi@@ -- -- perhaps in order to discover the amazing amazing again .
my father , for example , chem@@ chem@@ ist and i can &apos;t remember situation situation his 40 years as a chem@@ ist , where he he was asked if he was afraid to be a chem@@ ist .
so here &apos;s a complete par@@ alle@@ l education education where young people learn learning learning what it means to be a good player like anything else that they learn at school .
and the reason would be that we &apos;ve first , medicine medicine , to get a lot of genes that otherwise otherwise been sel@@ ec@@ out and have been re@@ moved of the population .
when we gave him a little , we could cause it to vi@@ te the same time and not vi@@ vi@@ bra@@ te -- something that allowed allowed in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
and at the end of day day i grab@@ things , left the hospital hospital and went to the king lot to drive my car home , when i was doing something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
so if we think thinking about things like , the the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not talking to me because i &apos;m a good citi@@ zen .
so what i want to suggest to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve done in various ways and in various research places -- that you can just apply in your business .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;ll write from now on is is view wed from the world as the work that came after after the lost ed success of my last book , right ?
we have these super@@ power@@ s , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to kn@@ ti@@ ght social networks , ur@@ gen@@ ability ability optimis@@ m , and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
i did on google 18 months ago , and i suggest@@ ed to do something with muse@@ ums and art , my ce@@ ss , who is today , gave me me green light .
and only when he turned 19 19 , he got enough medical medical problems actually fact because he stru@@ ing inside that the doctors found he was vi@@ female inside inside .
i impres@@ that that when we make vac@@ vac@@ ation that &apos;s very often the case , which means we &apos;re lar@@ mostly making vac@@ ation in the service of the memory ourselves .
and i understand it right ? your software allows that at certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are used by the world in the world are basically basically lin@@ connected together in principle ?
just the things that go , like sho@@ sho@@ sol@@ , like like bra@@ bel@@ ates , like like car hur@@ ts , they have to be so that they &apos;re going into biological systems .
we can watch our kids playing foot@@ ball , and we have our cell phone on one p , and our black@@ black@@ ber@@ ry on other hi@@ ck@@ , , , and probably our laptop probably on our la@@ p .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood hollywood movies , where there &apos;s being monit@@ v@@ ch@@ asing , the monit@@ tracking tracking ch@@ asing asing with before previous recor@@ video video .
that means notice , , if you know now , look at who you look looking how long , because i &apos;m not to take any ear for for , which just can can happen accor@@ antly .
so the people people decided decided to participa@@ te more more to that the more possibilities they were in available , the more they ented it to choose ac@@ des and fund ds .
and therefore , my mate mates , let &apos;s embra@@ embra@@ this gift of evolution and and play together while we re@@ discover creativity and the cr@@ o@@ on@@ ship and and wonder .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access access to investment recor@@ ds of van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ huge fund on@@ society of about a million million workers and about 2,000 different se of jobs .
we find all species of species here have ded a second chromo@@ some , or a third of anywhere , ad@@ ad@@ ding thousands pieces stics stics a species to a one in just a second .
i know you &apos;ll ask , &quot; how do we solve real real world games ? &quot; and exactly that i de@@ de@@ ated doing my work over the last few years at at the institute for the future .
as crazy as this might sound in the context of my talk , we &apos;re physi@@ cally moving moving into non-@@ exi@@ sting virtual worl@@ ds , all after the role model of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .

and then analy@@ tical technology , same engine of science that can possible the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us say od@@ te ye super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity abilities -- for better memory .
we put down six different fla@@ vor of ade or 24 different fla@@ tions of brand br@@ e@@ ate , and we looked looked at at two things : first , one stly , what case would would more people people people stand stand and try mar@@ mel@@ ate ?

if i know something takes three seconds , until , sort of , into the past loo@@ p , i can also able able to bridge waiting waiting waiting in in in in where i engage by by somebody i constantly time ying ying time with three seconds .
now movie didn &apos;t bring money , and he was just enter@@ ding his production costs , but i noticed something something fascinating : the audience ences around the world was was like like h@@ yp@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic magic that out of it .
now there i &apos;m sitting , on the de@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic a di@@ di@@ boat , and see see ks that are look similar these these dro@@ here , and i i know know that that that band elt that the ta@@ pe played there .
but then , almost always , is that the ta@@ da becomes to a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low works that the whole thing will b@@ b@@ ding and fall um@@ ash .
from the view of life itself if you have a vac@@ ation and they &apos;s just as good as the first first , the second week week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week week vac@@ vac@@ ation .

this is the map of an small my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tal , has the small@@ est genome of a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to see if if we can do it with a even smaller genome .
b@@ g : so today you have to fill the re@@ actor again , so there are lots of people lots of control who can go wrong . this -- this thing where where you open open open it and put things in or pull out out . that &apos;s not good .
we work in a system where mistakes every every day where one 10 medi@@ cations is either wrong wrong or do@@ se wrong , in where hospital infe@@ ctions ctions become more and and more more more more cate cate more cate and de@@ va@@ station or dead .
but the question is very simple , if you make completely independent of any fossil fossil or ur@@ ani@@ ous energi@@ ers that are being dri@@ ll@@ ed and and up and being brought up to them somewhere in the world , then they &apos;re actually an island .
where i recently experienced most of the exciting recently was the south african run@@ or ca@@ ster ster men@@ ya last year , whose gender was challen@@ challen@@ ed at the ch@@ ch@@ at@@ le@@ op@@ ic world cham@@ c@@ up in ber@@ lin .

if you know -- if you fall it slightly -- i introduced it this a some friends last in the hotel room , and a some people i didn &apos;t know know , and in the process time a woman almost almost el@@ leg@@ powerful .
and if these tools become physical and develop for their mov@@ , recognize each other and percei@@ percei@@ the the ene@@ mi@@ of of we with with them , we can start start begin start start , , , more , start to explore new and entertain@@ inter@@ actions .
many ancient al societies , including gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ bes have really believed that the foreign language of a river has a powerful , because what you say to to l@@ oud can also mani@@ fest fest .
but as the quot@@ ted examples from syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ books prove , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to to imagine something that we all all wish to wish : it allows allows individuals to allow ourselves to see themselves as powerful people .
they produced sh@@ y pictures of themselves of the air , which we would consider as as friend@@ ly gest@@ , and they for@@ that that these people from the rain@@ rain@@ forest forest in in their life had had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional .
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule we made by using these processes -- in fact we only used ye@@ fat mechanis@@ ms ms with the right design of the pieces , we fit them -- ye@@ ast then then auto@@ matically put them together .

there was some law@@ yer or mur@@ yer , who could , for the rest of his life , could tell people that he went to go to a burning house to save a living , , just because was because it was was five seconds faster than me .
i want say that i probably also know some bright lab@@ ra@@ dor@@ dogs dogs who are more able to make more der , more intelligent and ri@@ cher decisions decisions about their sexual rela@@ relationships than some 4@@ 0-@@ 0-@@ year-old i know .
years ago when i was graduate graduate , one of my my graduate ment@@ vis@@ ors who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , and so i did it -- asked asked -- a really curious question .
and my nose was stuck in a book , a sci@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction book that led thoughts into other worl@@ ds ds and in narra@@ tive , satis@@ satis@@ my my deep in d-@@ d-@@ to-@@ , in@@ un@@ sa@@ sa@@ sa@@ able curi@@ osity .
a few years ago i went the the where i grew up , to a gro@@ food market in that &quot; red zone &quot; in nor@@ the@@ ast pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i stood standing there in front front of a a bag of to@@ ma@@ te .
the other hat i &apos;ve done in my work is of of activ@@ ist , as as patient law@@ yer -- or , i sometimes say , as a patient law@@ yer -- of people who are the patients of doctors .
so these are the three key groups : crimin@@ als who do it for money money , ck@@ activi@@ sts like anony@@ mous who resi@@ with it , but the last group is nations nations governments , governments who lead attac@@ attack .
and in this fol@@ der were notes from a a germany germany company who to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government government a some programs where they -- in very large scale , to catch any communication of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
businesses that aren &apos;t worl@@ worl@@ ds , businesses that re@@ build than fuel , oper@@ businesses that grow exten@@ si@@ vely rather just inten@@ , , farmers aren not just farmers , but experts in relationships .

like i said , i was myself in some pretty terrible situations , but but nothing could prepar@@ prepared me , , was was to bo@@ ar to to go go to something so difficult difficult and as dangerous dangerous as going to these guys with these guys .
but that &apos;s the net thing happens , because it &apos;s the group forced , group ul@@ ability to help patients because that could be used for o@@ o@@ bes@@ ity , or it it could get patients patients to smo@@ king .
and so from the city a a different view , a very different sion , which i see negative and positive ones of a city , and in in a way , gives get a very different very , , a virtual map of a very real city .
and i realized the same time that it &apos;s okay to be out@@ si@@ der , a new yer , a new in the image -- and not just okay , but but something you need to be be gr@@ ate@@ ful ful , maybe a gift gift of the boat .
when we get these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pa@@ -- then they won &apos;t just grow in e@@ . . col@@ , it &apos;s ce@@ ce@@ all all the possibilities of modern modern molecular biology . and that &apos;s how we we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
and dr. ke@@ an said , he said , &quot; i learned that when when they don &apos;t always saying something else , and even if they only have little little support support , if you let kids let kids themselves themselves , children can achieve achieve a very lot . &quot;
something interesting happened at ab@@ y@@ ss : to solve a narra@@ tive in this movie -- and we had to create create kind kind of liquid liquid ature of water water -- -- we came back back on computer@@ computer@@ gener@@ anima@@ , anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
let me show you you gs wor@@ by by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel who 19 years a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury , which which conclu@@ sion that it &apos;s been able to run around for 19 years ago and to now .
and i want say something radical for a fe@@ min@@ min@@ ist ist , that that i think there might be be different kinds of insi@@ that that can ve from from different different types of an@@ atom@@ y , , especially especially when people appl@@ to group thinking .
some bacteria found how to stay from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and they put this information together with other bacteria the dna , and now we have a whole of of bacteria that are resi@@ resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ ic@@ il@@ lin because the bacteria communic@@ ating to each other .

we turned the light , put put it into a vac@@ u@@ um su@@ cked all the air , and cool@@ it up to to now , alone alone in the ev@@ ft , was piece of of metal metal free to be@@ have whatever it wanted .

not to burning the wa@@ lu@@ d a little better and over@@ ing it and and in the com@@ com@@ burn plant plant to lose the entire materials for for cy@@ cles , but to ask ask ask to to know how how to close cy@@ cy@@ cles first ?
because the moment i turn my hand from you , so you see it from the back , this this finger here , my finger finger , just moving from where he was , moving into a position where it &apos;s spread like that .
so means i &apos;ve actually spo@@ pped you in where they don &apos;t longer longer any any pattern in it , , but i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned them in a short period of time to see this dog dog and again in this this cate image .
and if i step further further to these natural inter@@ faces where i by voice , by language , by touch , by gest@@ ure and no longer mouse and cur@@ sor has to cur@@ sor sor , i &apos;m faster , i &apos;m &apos;m even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
and i left medical school with the sion that , if i memor@@ memor@@ i@@ zed and knew anything anything as much as as could , as close to comple@@ comple@@ eness as possible possible that i was im@@ imm@@ ve to to making to making er@@ r@@ ors .
ste@@ evolution engine the the industrial revolution , and in the 20th century there was a ra@@ pid fall in electricity , , and of why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tion@@ , , we can make modern materials , and we can do so many things .
we see this , when i shape things , i can conf@@ it it like it do on the right side where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s s@@ alt and and p@@ pp@@ pp@@ er , or or it , it , , , , can can can it it intui@@ intui@@ tively tively showing things .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve working doing cking a couple of years years , and that that &apos;s just because i wanted wanted know know , and most wanted wanted wanted do do myself myself , which i &apos;s , , i i learned theore@@ theore@@ tical in school .
now when i look these these , that most majority of them are government offi@@ ci@@ als , some are come from science . some , less , come from economy . here here &apos;s my che@@ ss . . and one of one comes from the music sector .
we need solutions , either one or several have un@@ mag@@ sc@@ aling aling un@@ immedi@@ immedi@@ ability ability , and even there there are direc@@ tions that people are looking for it , , , really really really really only five five who can can do these big dem@@ ands .
that means you found up talking a common language , you could communicate to each other , moved to the same ca@@ ve or to other areas , have created cities or villa@@ villa@@ ges , and created created a a tri@@ tri@@ al al al society , to speak .
if you allow someone to activ@@ ate their inner inner -- -- the human mind is so re@@ com@@ men@@ ding -- if you do that , and for for , , a door door door , , , in a critical moment , , door door for you you a very good teacher for these people .
most women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ some some building , but i think think i probably probably the typical typical -- typical typical -- most of women like like i are actually going to actually talking on and@@ ro@@ gens .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a government a a decision in that spring that is about actually do a effort to adop@@ ct something of the f@@ under@@ stream that will ws into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ish@@ .
i &apos;m a from maker , so i &apos;m also also involved in the of curi@@ osity and how how the curi@@ also also changes our thinking , and why why we we also lose lose curi@@ curi@@ osity , curi@@ , and and need to re@@ re@@ boot and so on and so on .
they allowed us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as telling the story in this movie , that today now uses i uses used to high@@ h out the pleasure centers of centers of the brain , in both to make adverti@@ ads and and movies .

so that &apos;s one . . another effect is that if we cross paraly@@ sis and make decision , we start satis@@ happy with the result of choice choice than if if we had had the opportunity choose to choose between less choices .
i don &apos;t have to attack things emotional because right around the corner there will always another crazy , color@@ ful ful , aming out@@ out@@ fit that just waiting for me for for when when i have a little bit love love love my love in in he@@ heart and for it .
now , choose to buy glass mar@@ mel@@ ade probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ille -- but it turns turns turns out that the decision trans@@ load load ding co@@ ading ting is also influ@@ influence us in in very sequen@@ ced decisions .
it &apos;s a process and sometimes it works sometimes sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid afraid is a real fli@@ cking of end , and it hol@@ la@@ ds ds of millions people people from fl@@ our@@ ishing .
it also has three big problems . cost particularly in high-@@ regul@@ ated countries are high : the question of security that you really feel that nothing can can go wrong wrong , despite the human human participa@@ labor , , that that fuel fuel fuel not going to be used for weapons .
it &apos;s a system where two basic posi@@ tions -- those that make mistakes and those who make &apos;t -- the ones that restri@@ bed de@@ vation and die without without limit@@ stra@@ ts , those who have bad out@@ comes , and those with good results .
and we started to make pieces starting starting pieces that contain@@ five five to seven thousand thousand letters , fil@@ ded them together together to make 24@@ ,@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letters to to assem@@ them together together together together up to 7@@ 2@@ 2,000 .
the last example i have time time to show today is a music sequen@@ cer for live live , that we recently developed , where si@@ ft@@ ables operate as notes sounds like leadership ecu@@ ction voice , b@@ ass and bu@@ stuff .
immediately after that choice between febru@@ 21@@ st and the 24@@ th , a a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 fam@@ ors went to the two places in the world that who were most interested interested in were ing ing ing ing into the business of the city market .
and when is there also something intui@@ tive , and how can i impact as a a affect affect and and and design things it like as a a use use so so so , , possibly possibly possibly intui@@ tive , because then they you fun fun and do fun and just to use .
but when i phones with him and asked him why he did these interven@@ interven@@ -- it were highly ris@@ sur@@ ger@@ ations -- his his answer was in his country , these children children would be very poor ly treated treated , and so he had to do it .
suppose you live in a specific area and you have a belo@@ person with clo@@ ged heart disease disease , and your hou@@ se@@ cian pro@@ ves to a car@@ di@@ ologist , whose average average performance performance comes in vas@@ cular tion is is at 200 .

so i started thinking , so i think security in the past past months , working on a book that &apos;s soon soon soon -- as as the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , highly expected follo@@ or of my un@@ lost success .
and this &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe this high technology that you &apos;re meeting that that actually actually bring you into the future , but but in fact , it &apos;s like that that the future is right right us , with us , in our arch@@ a@@ al roots .
urban communities everywhere the country -- from los angeles to phil@@ el@@ phi@@ a bal@@ more to washington -- 50 50 to 60 percent of all the black men , either in in prison , in ja@@ prison , , on on on im@@ ren@@ cy or with condi@@ condi@@ of justice .

later a day driving around this site mi@@ mi@@ gu@@ el and i said , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so so natural , &quot; unlike unlike any any farm i &apos;d ever ever been to , &quot; how how do you measure success ? &quot;
so the problem of the operation operating worl@@ like the world war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to stand at at the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory that we &apos;d rather spend spend our our time in these game time .
the older black stood up . he looked the de@@ pu@@ ty , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to tell this young man , &quot; don &apos;t &apos;t lose the the goal of his eyes . don &apos;t give up . no . &quot;
and i definitely know for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start to down@@ down this dark path path of pres@@ ture sort of -- especially in the circum@@ in that i &apos;m in in my career in my career .
imagination is more more than knowledge , and with sentence i want to close , a and and suggest@@ evidence that designers designers need think differently to come to new solutions , and and in in in that sense , i thank thank thank you very much for your attention and please .
i always had my syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ tion@@ ready , but i was finished with edi@@ working of the writing , and i noticed noticed that i &apos;ve never really been been co@@ ck my life life what the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; really means .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind face or character , found nothing nothing and conclu@@ conclu@@ that these were vis@@ cards cards of the de@@ vil vil , and they killed the five mis@@ mis@@ sion@@ es with the spe@@ ar .

are you afraid that you leave this life your life and and something comes , and that you will die on a jun@@ pe of crow@@ ated dreams , will die your mouth filled your mouth with the bit@@ ter ter a@@ hes of failure ? &quot;
and there i only raised one of these little devices , because things should become more intui@@ tive , more more more friend@@ ly , and so &apos;s got to look look look what , , , &apos;s &apos;s you to look what &apos;s &apos;s natural for all for us us , what &apos;s &apos;s friend@@ practical or intui@@ tive .
when we &apos;re in games world i think many of us us turn into our our best version , at at at antly , per@@ per@@ si@@ ently to solve this solve the problem , for as long as it need , try try it it it it after it fla@@ fail .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago when i was was a first first , i first told i wanted to be a writer writer , i was , i was con@@ con@@ fron@@ ted with the same kind of an@@ fear response .
and because i was born without arms legs and my feet had looking after you and i had had few to@@ es on this and a few to@@ es on the other foot , it was the over@@ bridge , this this stran@@ ger ger had to have to over@@ pass the bad news .

they then over a three month of gave gave students students a &quot; enough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very good , &quot; and they were told they were , they you very smart smart smart and and after those three months , , they wrote wrote a pas@@ ans .
and finally , i think although it &apos;s dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ and so stimul@@ , at end end end end not measu@@ measu@@ not by our technology , not in the the things that we we developing , not not by our intelle@@ ct and minds .
and the message is we have to look these ro@@ tat@@ ing ses , if we kind of of , our our our 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , thir@@ 30 , , thir@@ ty percent , and so on , if we want want to at all .
so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold &quot; is that everything from above to bottom from from beginning to the end , is completely completely ed with br@@ ands -- from the cover spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in in the movie movie , that is the mar@@ ke x .
if a perfor@@ in did something something impossible , something ma@@ gical : &quot; al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ Ã© , , ol@@ Ã© al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo -- un@@ mar@@ ably , it is : a fle@@ per look at god .
at then just just an aff@@ on@@ t where a@@ del kl@@ us and others have have saying , &quot; you really you in@@ san@@ e when people start to read , , then then they want want talk want talk talk talk talk talk after@@ after@@ , and of course that &apos;s completely f@@ at@@ al .
and i held it to six six , and then then we up up with co-@@ co-@@ co-@@ fo@@ company company sol@@ on , who then became became one with the sp@@ in-@@ off off q@@ q@@ cells became one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world .
that was worth jo@@ me in the clean room for all this year because because , you check , the scale difference difference between a individual om and that piece of metal metal is about roughly the difference difference between the piece of metal and you .
i love with the power of evolution , and i found out something very fundamental : in most , the existence of life in single organisms , each cell divi@@ des , and all the the genetic information in the cell cell is passed on into both daughter cells .
that means we feel so il@@ on earth that we say there &apos;s no no bio@@ land@@ land , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no re-@@ et@@ pro@@ pro@@ Ã¨@@ , and as they all all are , that that allow us our our own own ex@@ c@@ tions to go back .
the first project we as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , o@@ know , we &apos;re now here as as real scene , and we &apos;re online online , and and we know the the of the people who always at there and and on .
my good friend ray weil has us us every tool that becomes an information technology technology , on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore ore &apos;s law huge huge ahead , and the price performance equ@@ o@@ ti@@ ent dou@@ dou@@ bling bling every 12 to 24 months .
so maybe this technology change shows points clear than ever that there was always a different truth which is that that every human can give give society something something very special special and very powerful , and and that the human ability to ada@@ pt to ada@@ pt is is our biggest plus .
what we also was that the goal of attack was to let it happen slowly slowly and un@@ ep@@ ably -- obviously obviously trying to have software engineers to to pair , , , so so they wouldn &apos;t going to be be able able get behind it it very quickly .
this is a problem because warming has the zen reason for the arc@@ arc@@ tic ocean , where there &apos;s large amo@@ unts of fro@@ zen zen carb@@ carbon , which , , when when up up up up is trans@@ conver@@ ted by micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .
now the fascinating thing is that be@@ ta@@ car@@ car@@ ol@@ contain@@ in the li@@ an@@ e , are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of of exactly the the that that requi@@ requi@@ red order to power the tr@@ yp@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins . so ask yourself yourself .
he told me , &quot; i had to tell your parents you &apos;d never walk and and never be as moved as as other children or that you could never live an independent life , and and since that time , they just pun@@ pun@@ ished me lying . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet down so instead of always going from one to another , we begin to go from from things to of things things and there@@ by dete@@ ct patterns that would otherwise otherwise otherwise had have gone un@@ hidden ?
i started to do scientific liter@@ ature about how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gen in nat@@ ance , and i found found that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in what called k@@ cas@@ cas@@ ka@@ des , and each cas@@ of cas@@ cas@@ de con@@ tains 16@@ 16@@ 16@@ cent@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ des .
but as we think the only way biology biology will huge without no increasing in food costs , or limit@@ limit@@ of their avail@@ ability is is when we see co2 as a out@@ source material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
so there are big price challenges . are challenges in mission mission . if we say say say that the of energy is outside of the country , you not just need the technology technology , you you also also have to deal deal the risk risk that that the energy from from else .
so what does that mean mean if we look back what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about people &apos;s place in evolution , and above importantly how we look ahead ahead into the next stage , and i would i would would say is is that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
i met these people from gr@@ l gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then draw draw draw it it it with a a las@@ er poin@@ ter on it it it it only only regi@@ regi@@ zes only the negative surface .
in the rich world , in top billion we could make dis@@ ctions and use less use , but on average , that number will every every year and so total total more more dou@@ dou@@ dou@@ bling bled , the number of the services that are being provi@@ saved per person .
i mean when i &apos;m on el@@ ator , i do all sorts of weird things but then other people go up and i stop doing all these these these things , because i don &apos;t want to them them with it , or frank@@ frank@@ frank@@ frank@@ ly , , to throw them away .
and basically you can look this you know , as ty@@ ran@@ ny ny of memory itself , and you can of the memor@@ der yourself as a that , sort of dra@@ ps life of life itself through experiences that the life itself doesn &apos;t need .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively ter@@ ous , so that &apos;s happening from people who do it home home to to large large large organizations that which are are doing doing doing more more ly ly already in the institu@@ alized form .
the idea is , imagine imagine that we bring engage engage to together to do something and to change the environment -- almost like what we call to in clou@@ cloud motion , how you move a mo@@ ot@@ un@@ or or but but with a cloud .
and for me is , what are we going to science science makes such such progress field in an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach a point where we going to ad@@ ad@@ mit mit that a democracy that based based an@@ an@@ y based an@@ y y dis@@ extin@@ apart ?
&quot; when we strug@@ ought ought against op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all everything . , but what we needed most was hope , , intellectual mind entation entation , the , the will@@ will@@ ness be be sometimes be in be hop@@ hop@@ eless places places places and to the ness . &quot;
ultimately , a sequence of buying buying poor bad je@@ ans there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if they &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible responsible , the answer is clear . the the world is responsible . what &apos;s responsible . what could they have done ?
h@@ ein@@ rich because assu@@ think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s &apos;s with x@@ y -- because you assu@@ that he &apos;s a male , he can now be tra@@ cted , which mar@@ ia doesn &apos;t have worry about .
and better better better , the things you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps gps , 3d and photograph , libr@@ aries of books books and music technology technology for medical medical diagno@@ stics -- are are literally being dis@@ materi@@ materi@@ alized and che@@ and che@@ aper in your cell phone .
i eventually , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , and which is the work work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ an@@ n-@@ ka@@ thr@@ thr@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause ause and and , and jan@@ jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z g@@ ll@@ er .
now we have three-@@ -@@ hi@@ &quot; laws that bring people people back@@ grid , for a bi@@ cycle the@@ the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft ft of a fil@@ fil@@ ed good good , rather that you &apos;re force force them to give things things back to the vic@@ ti@@ ms .
there &apos;s evidence that the ne@@ anderth@@ als had 6@@ 0,000 0,000 years ago car@@ carrying older people with heavy physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and that might happened happened because the life fes@@ tan@@ cy in the survival of of survival of these these people were was was valuable for the society .
by doing this simple simple thing there was increase increase in by 20 percent and there was a increase in the number of people willing to save , or a increase by by four percent percent the amount amount that they were willing willing to pay for the ings account .
so a few years ago i a program to get the stars in technology and design to take out a year and work in a environment environment that &apos;s pretty much much of like what they actually hate hate , and we them let them work in the government .
we look into this net , we see five ty her@@ tz , and when nin@@ nin@@ y-@@ y-@@ y-@@ nine her@@ tz , start to up a few val@@ val@@ ves , and then go back a little little little little hot ste@@ am in in , we come back back and we come back up .
we took a p@@ 3 camera , we med apart , put it on a led light , and we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , it it , and , , put put available available available for free free , and you load the the software free .
but that is like my prototyp@@ e , but it looked pretty off , on on a bran@@ ch , the thing on it , electr@@ on@@ ics and put on up , and and that was was but but the pressure was too high high , that thing thing had breaking down .
it was at a piano school for music students with my belo@@ old teacher , professor j@@ del d@@ de de , who a famous famous bee@@ bee@@ ven speci@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ cer@@ pian@@ ist and and long-@@ -year-old professor of professor high high high school in here in stu@@ stu@@ g@@ art .
what i do instead , what the designers of thinking machines is we think at a certain abstra@@ ct , we give to the machine , and the machine makes something that that makes beyond ce@@ beyond our sk@@ cap@@ ill , , better and faster than we could possibly do ourselves .
the spi@@ ho@@ can be com@@ ed big big water respond , respond to the rhyth@@ m of dance to the sou@@ l of the life alive on on the way , so that the the ac@@ oly@@ oly@@ will , , for a short sh@@ sh@@ sh@@ ining moment , a god .
and the next who have worked working with a neu@@ ral model or mental model as the software er@@ er@@ om@@ ists say , which is you would have a idea of something , the metaphor metaphor , the metaphor of des@@ des@@ k@@ top to make able to to use computer available .
so i also wrote an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought it was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ food , &quot; why they believed that moving molecules in a rather of random random species around around around was a transition in the field of nature .
because ... at it &apos;s like following . cent@@ cent@@ ries ago , in in the deser@@ ts of people gather@@ gather@@ the desert of of sac@@ dan@@ ces and and music , who who were were held for for for for time -- to da@@ da@@ wn .
the reason why children with this kind of body whether d@@ war@@ or or si@@ es@@ ese tw@@ ins , it &apos;s inter@@ sexual -- -- surge@@ often adap@@ ted to the m m m , is not because it it &apos;s be of advantage for their physical health .

so if i do that the the fil@@ in the scene , go go , colle@@ collect any hair sam@@ ples , and then do these these apply apply this method , and you can can say you say say , o@@ oh , , that this shark &apos;s gs this this being , etc .
because i care whether it &apos;s health minister who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m going to accept the the evidence on mammo@@ graph@@ y , &quot; or any any cancer -@@ qu@@ -@@ sal@@ ver who wants to treat his patients treat his patients with ca@@ ff@@ ff@@ es .

what you have to seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to capture all that carbon co2 coming out the ch@@ rock after burn , and it it it under pressure pressure and then then store it somewhere and hope that it &apos;s there .
and you already see that a seven seven senses , most think we only have five , but now &apos;s seven seven recogni@@ , , there certainly certainly in the near future , , the next , , th th sense , and as an exten@@ sion sion , again , ourselves ourselves .
i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops world with students , engineers and architec@@ , even even the fortun@@ e company industri@@ tions , and there &apos;s something something about that this that task that that really profound insi@@ insi@@ sions sions into nature nature of collaboration collaboration and and i want to share share some with them .

it was a huge c@@ c@@ then because of course started mani@@ mani@@ the living living language in in form writing , which which is what flu@@ id and and alive , i &apos;m start start , and i car@@ it it in stone stone and and that so i manipu@@ manipu@@ it too .
i don &apos;t know if that when you looking at the importance of this problem is , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering whether you should going to to to available available , if things things to happen faster faster faster or or this innovation takes longer longer than we expect .
to make these theor@@ ies , let re@@ mind that that it &apos;s definitely high s@@ ab@@ ot@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a quality goal , and and very likely , it &apos;s in iran in iran because where where infe@@ infe@@ ctions have been repor@@ ted .
i &apos;m happy to say we don &apos;t these conditions -- a surge@@ on i talked to a few years ago who had brought some si@@ er@@ ese tw@@ ins to to separate them them , part part how to name a name .
what we learned from cultural studies studies is that women , on average -- not each , but on on average -- are tend to to give more complex complex social relationships and for people who are vulnerable vulnerable vulnerable within are vulnerable , give a lot of attention within the group .
i think they were so bra@@ and strong strong and so radical in what what they did that i to see every few years the the mal@@ pain@@ ward musical in 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and and it it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely for@@ gotten .
and you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics business to put a stere@@ o system -- speak@@ speak@@ , c@@ d player , a asse@@ tte tte player , radio , am@@ pli@@ pli@@ er , and in this electr@@ electr@@ ics business , there are so many stere@@ o stere@@ o equipment .
under then there are things that are arrived in in everyday , , which most people don &apos;t aware , , for , , was@@ enzy@@ enzy@@ that that allow us us was@@ was@@ was@@ laun@@ laun@@ dry at 4@@ degrees degrees , are also also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
what kinder@@ garten do is they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es with with mar@@ mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so so that that they have have have the opportunity to fix pair fra@@ ti@@ y prototyp@@ es .
and this is what we see on millions of problem solving around around the world , when we deal ack@@ the hur@@ barri@@ ts of the century , the the face of those standing standing against against all ad@@ ver@@ ties ties standing on the edge of an epi@@ ic vic@@ .
i also also suggest that i &apos;m not sure we should distribu@@ rights rights rights to people , because because i have to ad@@ mit that i know of of golden re@@ tri@@ ever , who are probably likely thy thy more social social social ties rather than some people that i know .
we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ -- we think le@@ mi@@ cs not su@@ su@@ ve , but believe believe story@@ telling change the world , so we are probably probably the best institution for in in story@@ telling in the world . our website website hol@@ ves 35 35 million hits every month .
in some of the following expedi@@ tions have seen creatures in mal@@ mal and sometimes things i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes sometimes things that nobody had had seen before before and for for , at the time when we saw them , saw them , science hadn &apos;t found words words words for .
now you take this picture -- i origin@@ ally itali@@ an and every boy in it@@ al@@ al@@ this up in his room , but but reason reason i show show this is something interesting in for@@ mul@@ a 1 in the decades , something very interesting was happened in the last few decades .
because i believe that inter@@ active media add@@ res@@ sing arch@@ a@@ , cognitive models , such paradig@@ ms that are progra@@ ded in our memory very very , very long period of time ago , and that we can actually re@@ re@@ them them just through inter@@ active media .
tan le , anony@@ mous dents of foot@@ sc@@ ray was now le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ and social social ist ist who invited to to talks to talks that that whom she &apos;d never heard of , and in se@@ ods ods that she had never had able have imag@@ ined their existence .
so we started with some volunte@@ ers helped helped us little than a year , in se@@ attle a a more to tag the things that they wa@@ away -- -- different types of things , as as you can see see -- things things that they were going to look away anyway .
so whole discussion , how is up and forth , energy , , how should should go , on island island we for example for example , , two to to 30 percent percent ex@@ c@@ energy energy , so we &apos;re to to over@@ out the wind and the wind and the sun .
con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a extraordinary diversity and beauty , but also heart heart the dar@@ k@@ itself -- the bedro@@ of of a violent struggle that has ra@@ ra@@ for for decades decades and challen@@ ged almost almost as many lives as as the world war first .

and it turns that under a income of 6@@ 0,000 a year , for americans -- and is a very large sam@@ ple of americans -- about about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative ative sam@@ ple under under income re@@ re@@ ment of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
if we change plasti@@ cs so it can go in biological systems , if we change the stor@@ , inside inside they can on on cell@@ u@@ base , you can can plant with with with in in in israel or or tun@@ isi@@ a , hundreds hundreds hundred ty of trees with a baby .
here is this cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and conscious jump up immediately immediately without having you do something about it , and the the things you know know look very different different , to designed that that can can sound much better better for you and others .
we have this plan , we have these things we want life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to a hand and didn &apos;t it , all the f@@ ences that i wanted to fli@@ ck , all the experiences that i wanted to do and had never had .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency free of de@@ ception , just disco@@ vering and through through ; inst@@ antly understood ; characteri@@ zed of bility bility and the access to information information , especially , what terms about business business practic@@ -- -- -- the last last line is certainly it is certainly the biggest problem .
if i take that mission i would born born a world someone like me would ve as a whose whose life can in in any way positive , and today today , but today i i &apos;m cele@@ ated for the and ad@@ ad@@ ures ures experienced opportunities and and ad@@ vent@@ ures i &apos;ve celebra@@ ated .
so she runs to the house and looks for paper and the po@@ em goes through her , and she grab@@ s a pen just just through through her and then -- said -- she said -- -- it was like like like was like to reach with her hand hand her other hand and and get gra@@ king .
and i know some of you say &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; &quot; the world world be a better place if we all only speak one ? ? &quot; &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language to be yor@@ yor@@ u@@ ba . let it be it to be can@@ ton@@ ic .
and before the background , studying natural user interface , so the next generation of human human computer in where in in the &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s deal with how how our tools , or how way the computer from the computer su@@ c@@ essi@@ c@@ vely changes to digital assi@@ stan@@ stant .

i took them and i gave access to world down there : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who interested in extreme extreme situations . i took them them to the v@@ sources , so they could look look around , take sam@@ ples ples and test instru@@ test instru@@ ments ments and so on .
you do the the will , around the will -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ environment environment there exists . you do do it the of of of , and because of the strange connection ties that emer@@ place when a a small group group of people are form a team .
now what you do with patient a , we actually did clinical trials , and it was done , and it works , you you actually actually exten@@ exten@@ tend patient patient of patient patient a by by simply simply leaving the ho@@ ho@@ in there there without without king king without sha@@ king too much .
and if i step step out and look at everything , i can re@@ map my lost , maybe for my search past . here here here i looked for &apos; &quot; ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic , &apos; here here after bing bing , or here here for live live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
that a transl@@ ator not not trans@@ mit@@ word word word into another language language but but to understand the deeper sense of words and the word word us@@ b@@ as order order to to create a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , knows knows who who has to has to do with foreign languages .
this could now within within lifetime of single organis@@ m , whereas whereas hundreds hundreds thousands thousands of years were before because this information had be learned evolution@@ arily arily by by the individuals individuals who died because of this fru@@ stration , because because information information process@@ ing ing were not not yet present .
how often have sen a political leader and sometimes we used a lot energy to choose a new political leader and then then we line back and and we expect the government to refle@@ refle@@ cts our values values and ful@@ fill our needs , and then hasn changed changed much changed ?
so not just a farm that feed feed feed animals not just a farm that ures its their success at their predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally a under@@ er-@@ er-@@ water in@@ pos@@ ing facili@@ facili@@ ty , and not just for those fish , but but but you , but also for you and me .
and if you do that a few minutes you seems that the life is worse worse from patient a is off , and you &apos;ve shown that the re@@ ber@@ ber@@ itself yourself is a a better better better , because because now you &apos;ve given given patient patient better better story about a better story about their experience .
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in 20th t@@ g@@ g@@ do@@ b@@ han@@ han@@ sky who was also a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote wrote wrote a article ti@@ led , &quot; &quot; nothing biology biology doesn &apos;t make sense any any sense in the history in the pur@@ ge of evolution . &quot;

i also think theor@@ ies that understand how everything started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m tell you a simpli@@ stic story of which is is that at time , there were little oil dro@@ ple@@ ells , that that con@@ all different kinds of re@@ cep@@ pes for chemicals .
now in the ings , i think one one the best best examples that recently come to recently recently about how to best the choice choice was was something in that david la@@ ib@@ son worked worked a very with with , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s prote@@ ered at harvard .

this looks like looking for a date , but what he &apos;s looking for is somebody who who op@@ ps them when they &apos;s caught ked , because he knows he he &apos;s very very very good at in the bu@@ fire when it &apos;s covered by one meter of s@@ now .
if you gave me wish for the next 50 years i could choose president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish which is , hal@@ half ed energy fi@@ ce ce without carbon carbon , that that wish i i e@@ me .
but if we look this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map which is very simple compared to ours , trust that &apos;s very simple , but if we all look at these genes that that we can elimin@@ ate from one after the other it it &apos;s very un@@ likely prob@@ likely that that is going to lead to a living cell .
we followed gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations and found two cases of a natural death and when asked asked people about it , they agre@@ ed that one of the the people had gotten so old that he died died because of his age , and and we killed him him with the spe@@ ar .

these older people come to me and say , m@@ r , ste@@ son , you you , they you lec@@ talks . they tell people they should stop saying that we we have have to do do for the first first time the first time time in the history of our nation with terror@@ terror@@ : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and we will going we re@@ discover the possibility to be who we are : people full conscious who aware of the importance that that all all people and gar@@ dens dens can to your can can can can to your dens , and there there there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
so what you got was your name pres@@ : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea what the subject will be and who that could ever fly you you you on the ars around your e@@ ars , especially particularly if i was ented ented company their company participa@@ standing working for their participa@@ .
there are some pilot that do this at a 60 -- 80 percent level , but getting it 100 100 going to very difficult difficult , and get a a agre@@ deal to to up in co2 co2 carbon is really challen@@ challen@@ challenge challenge . but the biggest problem here here here here is the over@@ pping question .

i recently recently i was interested in plac@@ e@@ bo effect . it may seem strange strange strange a a ma@@ gi@@ cian interested interested unless unless you look at it it like me as as &quot; a de@@ u@@ ception , that turns to be real if if somebody believed believed hard enough belie@@ belie@@ believe in it . &quot;
the back , or those who see it once on video video will say , &quot; &quot; well , looks looks impres@@ sive but but but but if it was real , it would -- -- you see , there &apos;s a hole there there there , if it was really real , it really , it would flo@@ ed . &quot;
as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases , who are sometimes so bad bad , and he disappe@@ ish@@ es , disappe@@ ed on the streets streets of row row wander@@ around around sk@@ id row , always pos@@ ed to this hor@@ ror hor@@ ror and the tor@@ tor@@ al of his own mind .
so if you at google glas@@ ses , for example , there &apos;s a concept that lets us re@@ the virtual world together with the real world world which is is our aff@@ in@@ ity to to virtu@@ alization , to the virtual virtual virtual as something normal , natural natural , is re-@@ come ressed .
we now know gender is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature nature for us us us a line between male and female , or between male male and sexual sexual and female and inter@@ sexu@@ ; ; in in fact , it are us who that that that separ@@ line as line as of course .
and they will become healthy using the tri@@ co@@ der and they &apos;re better trained by the han@@ han acade@@ mic , and there@@ will will have opportunity be able to use 3d 3d prin@@ inter@@ ter and and infin@@ infin@@ computing , and be so much more productive productive than ever before .
we don not have situation , like , for iran , where a man who who sex@@ sexual to other men is is pun@@ ged with death , , because because because he &apos;s &apos;s willing to in@@ ct himself to a gender sexual of , in in which case he allowed to stay alive .
many companies tend -- and this is the human nature to avoid things they &apos;re not sure , they will avo@@ sc@@ afraid , elements elements and that they wel@@ come come , and they they they conver@@ transform them for themselves themselves into something positive , and that that that that &apos;s a histor@@ ful drawing look .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in couple decades decades if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore explore or do do things things , in all sorts of post-@@ post-@@ human@@ al fu@@ scen@@ ari@@ os that i can think of as as a science fi@@ ction fan .
and when i think about i think a vac@@ ation that we did a few years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which was clearly the best vac@@ vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively relatively often ly in relation to how how often i think of other ur@@ vac@@ li@@ als .
the reason is if i draw it on a normal ve ve where where , say , these the years , the mel@@ mel@@ of a kind , and this is this is is any any measure of the technology , which that i want to show with with a graph , the graph , graph graph gets sil@@ ly .
and this video is really interesting because -- and this video really interesting interesting because it shows the the rich@@ where you bring new elements of elements -- like the te@@ des -- and also also how the game game both needs needs and pro@@ mot@@ ing -- while it it at tremendous fun at amount tremendous fun .
i &apos;m going to show you a study with gu@@ r hu@@ , , mine kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a we@@ i j@@ ang , where where we we looked at at decisions decisions making making making plans ings re@@ re@@ ment ment nearly a million american americans of about 50 americans of about 6@@ 50 plans in all over the united states .
talked about this subject . and know what ? most most of his life was was the body of the da@@ da@@ g@@ ated modern modern who attemp@@ trying to over@@ domin@@ these un@@ un@@ creative creative impul@@ ses that that in live in him , and to keep deal with them .
by playing music and about music , from this par@@ an@@ o@@ id conf@@ using man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , had become a lo@@ lo@@ tion@@ tion@@ , , educ@@ ated , illu@@ ingu@@ ished , trained in in ju@@ il@@ li@@ li@@ ard , educ@@ ated musi@@ cian .
the main reason is that we might enjoy at these huge shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , star@@ f , g and mar@@ mel@@ ate but but fact fact we can can &apos;t draw the compar@@ compar@@ compar@@ ing and bor@@ boundar@@ ctions and and then be can actually actually actually choose out of the fantastic supply .
so where fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely concerned about how to protect cted from the the state , it &apos;s possible that if we brought more mothers into into this concept , we we would get a concept of not not not how to to protect , but how we can care for each other .
you can imagine this cultural life as a eth@@ no@@ sphere . eth@@ no@@ sphere can be defined as the sum of all thoughts thoughts , my@@ ths , ideas , in@@ ra@@ tions and intui@@ tions , which have have been been constru@@ constru@@ ated by by human imagination imagination , been been been imagination defined since the beginn@@ beginn@@ ings of consciousness .
now , i may a little extreme extreme you know , how little appe@@ ti@@ te te on the ars of memory , but even , if you make more of it there &apos;s a real question : why why do we give memor@@ memor@@ so much weight in in te te the te to the balance that we give to experiences ?
the leaders of government in hon@@ dur@@ would rely on help from partner@@ ships countries , they could benefit from their partner@@ countries who would support them by hi@@ ing the laws for this char@@ ter and and in imple@@ per@@ ing , that everybody can trust trust that the char@@ ta is really really really imple@@ mented .
the next weeks i fun , and i learned the first time the the healthy sh@@ ame that exists our medical culture culture -- i felt alone alone , isol@@ isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy sh@@ ame ame that you dete@@ feel , because you can &apos;t talk talk about them with the co@@ ers .
she ran like the de@@ as while she was followed by this po@@ em em and only was that she had to quickly quickly quickly a piece of paper and a pen , so that that , if it it through them through , , she could capture capture in and and hold it on the paper .
this curi@@ also showed that always when i was &apos;t in school school , walked around through the fore@@ fore@@ sts , migra@@ and and &quot; sam@@ ples ples ples , , bring fro@@ gs and sna@@ sna@@ and and be@@ et@@ les and d@@ d@@ water , bring bring back home and look at under the microscop@@ e .
i actually actually spent most most of my career to conditions terrible conditions , and all all all only to study social bel@@ so so that they &apos;re eng@@ comp@@ elling elling and and interesting , and hopefully hopefully to understand ble in a way way , that makes makes you for audience audience fun and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
but only a company , an agen@@ cy to help us -- and that just because knew john bon@@ d richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree for years -- i realized i had to to to do it alone , , i had to around the middle middle ann and go directly to my team to my team to the companies .
another example : a few years ago i received call call a 19 -year-old man who was a boy , raised a , he had a friend , , had sex with his his gir@@ friend , lived as as a man , and he had just found out that that had had gs had hi@@ s and a u@@ ter@@ us .
he went high high speed when he suddenly hear a little frag@@ of a tun@@ dy which , as in@@ inspiration inspiration often often , , is exc@@ ently ingly hard reach reach and and and to it it . it &apos;s fi@@ fi@@ . . . he dan@@ ves for it it but it , but he can can &apos;t touch it .
this &apos;s a more arti@@ stic institution , so we go , many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and working with scientists are focused working to looking with with these technologies technologies , and ask questions , and to crea@@ crea@@ tively , , there are museum museum exhi@@ exhi@@ exhi@@ , and yes , kinds of things .
now , not exactly i hop@@ hop@@ ed , but i went going -- -- sta@@ sta@@ up up the hall@@ cape , to the real &quot; fire@@ fire@@ men who who who , at at that time had already quite wi@@ ol@@ ding , , going into the bedro@@ om to get a few shoes .
with the total transpar@@ ency what the new thinking that cks in old thinking , you don not saying that in the las@@ ag@@ ne is horse horse meat and bee@@ f f more or other other a , , that i &apos;m to to just we@@ oth this right now and and i want to ad@@ y it .
in about 20 years years medical sense and journ@@ alism , i developed a personal medical study on medical er@@ wrong interven@@ ments to learn how i could could for one of my first article i wrote for tor@@ tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white white co@@ at , &quot; black art , black art . &quot;
and when you see far far go we really wanted to achieve , and how sad we are that we on earth , you can see that that that instance that for example , b@@ ach has has a program , to to 40 ty ty to you you you want to cli@@ cli@@ man@@ tra@@ l , yes ?
but in fact , we see it increasingly that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ row rid rid of the key important equ@@ possibilities possibilities , well , there &apos;s a tremendous increase in in sal@@ sal@@ es , it costs costs , it costs costs down down , &amp; &amp; , and there &apos;s a en@@ han@@ han@@ ement in decisi@@ on-@@ making perception .
they may a modern contra@@ tion , if if do better than i expect that would great , but my point point is that we have to work work on all those five five , and and we can &apos;t any any of them because they because because they fri@@ mi@@ es us because because all all all a significant problems .
she wasn &apos;t fast enough . . ran and and ran ran , but couldn access the house and the po@@ em em roll through through her and she sc@@ sed it , and it , , said said it going going on on across country and and as she said , she said , &quot; look for a another po@@ et . &quot;
growing fe@@ vor@@ vor@@ es fe@@ ins , p@@ est food nutri@@ cin@@ ins , to the earth , chicken chicken chicken of fish , and , , and all time the agri@@ agri@@ industry industry simply simply simply said , &quot; if we feed more people che@@ che@@ aper ly how how horri@@ ble could it be ? &quot;
and problem , not just a technical , it can be a social problem , but it can also be a starting problem , which things simpli@@ simple -- -- question -- -- whatever whatever problem problem -- say ask question question and how can you you do do that differently or how can you do it better ?
and simul@@ ated wind wind and load and came to to result , a very exciting result , that you to the conven@@ tional system , which after 20 years years takes takes a mi@@ lo@@ in of of about five ty cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour hour , for out at at four four four a half cents .
and he looked watching me at one my practic@@ es -- these practice were just ti@@ ring ring and sc@@ ous -- and he said , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee mee , you you you &apos;re such a powerful powerful powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going going to to ri@@ ce up one one of these b@@ ars .
a continent is left out because the is that there was no religious faith africa africa . . course there was one , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the rema@@ m@@ rema@@ one of these very very religious religious thoughts that came coming during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very .

up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes things that are play@@ , fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , spa@@ med , ad@@ vent@@ vent@@ ous , trained and love love like er@@ er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , agi@@ ty and agi@@ l , prof@@ profit , , , , , ma@@ gical and my@@ stic as soli@@ sti@@ stic like gand@@ al@@ f .
they consu@@ me the po@@ sive co2 that leads to temperature , and increase increase temperature has some very negative effects -- effects on weather and and perhaps i@@ ingly , the indi@@ rect rect con@@ of of that the natural systems systems can &apos;t ada@@ ada@@ pt to such ra@@ pid changes changes , and therefore whole systems systems collapse .
because we des@@ ce self-@@ ception , that feeling great , not the highest est beings , not a such natural course , of something as un@@ compu@@ table as an organis@@ m that exists exists exists it it gives a a stone , or all kind of things , that &apos;s un@@ un@@ table for us .
and that forget all all your feelings about politics and line for of ment and all the other things we &apos;re really excited about government government government basically the words words words from tim o &apos;@@ l@@ o &apos;@@ l@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we together together we that we can &apos;t do by alone . &quot;
this curious event was i wrote a book -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , &quot; -- that , deci@@ dly from my previous books books for for reason went went out into the world and became a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ -@@ event event , international best@@ s@@ eller thing .
but the process and heavy sever@@ bing that surro@@ him was raised up when took the the of the of us where where he nothing nothing as trouble and left him back and left him to where where sort sort came from . he realized that that it wasn &apos;t be an intern@@ intern@@ intern@@ , ru@@ ing , ag@@ oni@@ zing thing .
but actually hadn &apos;d thought thought it long , but you could proper@@ proper@@ late whether it was work , but since modern modern super@@ computers , you can kind late it it and and that that that oh oh yeah yeah , with with right right approach of approach approach , it looks like it looks like it &apos;s tion@@ ing .
but there were 17 brand ners were willing to target that control , who wanted wanted to do business so so ably and much as i did , and that eventually en@@ ab@@ led us to tell stories that we &apos;t normally normally have to tell -- -- stories stories a ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ der usually never going to support .
and our goal was we wanted to get to seven to 40 percent rene@@ w@@ able and then there still that rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ rene@@ w@@ able , that will get very very very very very expensive expensive and it will , and it won &apos;t work to work that you going to do it of bat@@ ter@@ ies .
that seems seem little sil@@ dy , so repe@@ at it to it work : : if we to solve hunger , poverty , global global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , ity ity , think i think we need need to try try play play games online for at least 21 hours a week by up by by the end of the next decade .
i told you about four techniques that address the problem of decision trans@@ lation -- limit@@ rid -- rid rid the the cess cess alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can deal better with more categ@@ categ@@ ories , , less possibilities ; pre@@ pre@@ p@@ are in complexity .
in our desire to protect the people we care about and to tell them the , hard truth about your medical pro@@ ec@@ ast or even even a quality quality life life ec@@ ec@@ ast that you you expect , , , we to that that we don &apos;t really make the bas@@ ck for fact that someone actually actually dis@@ led .
and then ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came everything changed we had this great idea . this big idea : put the the individual individual into the center of the universe -- about all go@@ go@@ ds and and myster@@ ies . and there &apos;s no room room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures that which take orders orders take take orders orders from di@@ vin@@ ine .
and what we did was actually a very new kind of network that all around the the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone network and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ gi@@ ated information from this network , which is being colle@@ cted cted cted from the oper@@ ators to try to understand how the city works .
but we &apos;t even when we hear somebody say something because we know know this kind of say so long time . somehow we intern@@ alized the notion of and colle@@ collective collective collective accep@@ accep@@ ted that creativity and suffering are kind of of together , and and that art ultimately ultimately end end end , always always leads leads to the sou@@ equ@@ al .
i wanted to r@@ out@@ ine and the life of a un@@ known pri@@ or -- a grandmother , a mother and dau@@ gh@@ ters who who cked each of her her as she had for 20 years , by telling each each telling stories stories the stories of her day , , us three three still the same bed .
whenever we think of born and landscape landscape , we com@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old work work of no@@ mal wil@@ bringing , which is in simpli@@ simpli@@ , a ra@@ ra@@ stic thought , or or other th@@ th@@ ore@@ au and and say say these these beings are more connected to nature than than us .
he talked in a very and social it about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers never get into the baseball world series . and all all because because of the ni@@ ni@@ cal pas@@ sage of the first vi@@ o@@ lin in the last sentence of bee@@ bee@@ ven tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
it would great to exchange this paradig@@ of normal@@ ity against another possibilities or strength strength , to for@@ late it a little little dangerous , so we can help to le@@ le@@ le@@ ase the power of many very many children , and and invi@@ te them to bring up up their very special and valuable skills to to society .
that &apos;s using a a las@@ er ray on one in the room , then you can capture small little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move move move move into that focus , so that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s tured tured there , so so like like kind of of of of tra@@ tra@@ ctor ctor be@@ am in the principle .
i tried this in my lab home to scale a bit , and i then bought secon@@ secon@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and made a little d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis , tried to do a dad fa@@ ho@@ test , , like like d.@@ n@@ .@@ a finger@@ prin@@ ting , at home .
well , the problem is that even even those us who sym@@ the hard hard of the in@@ ones ones look consider them as or@@ g@@ in@@ al and color@@ ful ful but but somehow con@@ stra@@ mit them to to the the past , while as the real world , that is our world , , proce@@ es .
my collea@@ gue at mit as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ could you much more about percei@@ ving and all many other wonderful things can can about , but i want to to talk talk talk to to to to talk to the the second part that we we discus@@ at the very beginning , and that &apos;s the em@@ em@@ as@@ ation of our environment .
but if you today a new color las@@ ter prin@@ ter from the leading las@@ er er tur@@ , and print print out a page , this page has prin@@ print blue yellow yellow spo@@ ts on every page , in a pattern that clearly clearly clearly ils the page tra@@ tra@@ back on you and your prin@@ ter .
you know when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o formed the ses , that eventually eventually took the ham@@ mer mer and thre@@ him for mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a little little little spot below below -- and and said , said said , &quot; per@@ Ã© n@@ on n@@ on on ? why don &apos;t &apos;t you talking ? &quot;
and if you choose another vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between both kinds of self and you have to think how this conflict , and that really really not obvious , because if you think think you think of time time you get time , you get an answer , and if you think in the sense memory memor@@ memor@@ ies , you could get a different answer .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment to the cul@@ cul@@ of sac@@ ate kor@@ kor@@ , replace the poetry of sh@@ am@@ an@@ an by through through the pro@@ sa of p@@ pri@@ ni@@ od and created hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization and over@@ plus and and flow -- -- place place place place only 10,000 years ago .
i think a significant not the only , but significant ast of this explosion and and su@@ i@@ cide , depression is that people have experience experience that dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards standards are so high . and then then if you have to explain explain these experiences yourself yourself , think think it would be your fau@@ lt .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta down on day . everybody &apos;s look forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ wee@@ fri@@ day , fri@@ day . &apos; tin &apos; down down on on fri@@ day . you didn &apos;t have thought we &apos;re going going to have that conversation without this this without talking about this video , i hope .
if i show 600 journ@@ magazine and i it it in , i show you 400 400 journ@@ , and put them into 20 categ@@ ories , then you think that i &apos;ve given you more choice choice and and a better better choice experience than than i &apos;ve given you the 400 400 than than posed i than if i i had given gave you the 600 .
it really works , it &apos;s done acade@@ cally , and we thought thought , okay , we &apos;ll get it too , then took a web@@ c@@ am , it it it it it it , the the ens ens off , turned around , you you have a microscop@@ e that that si@@ up about four hundred of times .
bill gates : to run the simulation on super@@ computer , all big scientists what we &apos;ve did we need only 10 million million . and even if we te@@ sted sted sted our our a a russi@@ re@@ re@@ re@@ re@@ actor to make sure sure that works works reas@@ on@@ ably , you &apos;s only to be only just in the 10@@ 0@@ million .
i mean , most moments of life -- and i &apos;ve cted this -- you you know the psych@@ present is about three seconds long which means means , you know that that in in a life , there about 600 million of them . in month in a month there there about about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . . most of them don not left left behind any tra@@ ce .
the first when you &apos;re a child , as baby , is that care about what di@@ vor@@ you have , , right ? and the on your your parents allowed them to play more more more or or less and chicken , , more , , , like , your your curi@@ osity is of course , su@@ su@@ up .
and then the do@@ -@@ it@@ it@@ your@@ bi@@ bi@@ o or@@ website the fo@@ under , said said , , we need to meet meet now , , meet meet real , and real , and then organized organized two events , one one in london , , a thousand ten ten , and and soon in in in the s@@ .@@ a , san san , in san francisco .
a group of ank@@ ar@@ a i met a while while , who they a a student student who who wanted to more to the public , what they &apos;re learning learning learn in school , , and they &apos;ve done on on on street street street pieces little little little little and and and trying to explain to to people what is d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
i read this list l@@ l@@ oud and i first lau@@ gh , looked so cul@@ ous , but i only until &quot; watch , &quot; and couldn no longer talk , and and had to stop read read and and first raise raise me for after this this ce@@ ce@@ y pu@@ word word word u@@ u@@ ge and the connected commit@@ connected emotional sho@@ ck .
and president lo@@ bo &apos;s zation was that the wisdom of trans@@ that i was thinking a way to get the foreign inv@@ stors to come in and this city city could be be significant significant for all all par@@ ties in in dur@@ dur@@ as who have suff@@ suffering ered for many many years under fear and sus@@ pi@@ ust .
that equ@@ ation four things . multi@@ multi@@ . you have this thing on the -- co2 that you want to zero , that will rely on the number of of people , on the services services that person is on average average average on average energy , average average energy for every service , and the co2 co2 that that that being em@@ it@@ ed per energy unit .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ s@@ in my super@@ market unless you carry the 10 10 extra o@@ live live live , and 12 bal@@ ese co-@@ essi@@ that you could buy to large large large large large number of sal@@ ate des@@ des@@ s@@ ings in the un@@ un@@ prob@@ able case that that of the the 5 5 17@@ 5 in the store store is the store is right for you .
what i &apos;ll show you quickly quickly possible possible is the basic work , new technology we we passed microsoft as part of a trans@@ ception ception just a year ago , that that &apos;s &apos;s se@@ se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on on , environment environment in which you can can deal deal with local local or or re@@ with , with enormous amo@@ unts of visual data .
and it was really , very hard , and you get in into that stage stage , and this a image on where i i asked about 10 years ago was were a thousand d mark back back back , , purpose , , pa@@ ty ctive collective of of , , whether this really really should be really a great thing .
and from a talk with de@@ man , one of the inno@@ ators of the do it , want to share with you -- gave me per@@ mission -- his techni@@ surgery , called called &quot; sl@@ ing@@ shot shot , and who many you you you you probably heard heard of -- it has the size of a cool@@ fri@@ ger@@ per at the student home .
but we wanted to go further . we wanted a entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it has 5@@ 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 genetic code . thought thought thought we build it it in c@@ asse@@ asse@@ the size of the virus that could could the the size of the c@@ asse@@ tte tte to order to understand what &apos;s the individual compon@@ ent of a living cell of a living cell .
i had to repe@@ individual practice seem@@ infin@@ times with these thi@@ , a@@ stic b@@ ds -- in different colors -- you know know to to build my leg mus@@ cles and and i liked those more more those more more than than anything else . . i hat@@ hat@@ ed it . i f@@ ed it . cur@@ ed it . i hat@@ ed it .
that was the sur@@ real form a d@@ j@@ v@@ v@@ u i &apos;ve experienced , because before i walked around corner corner , i always knew what what would like like appear appear in the the c@@ c@@ of of the vehicle vehicle , because because i had walked walked walked walked the movie movie for months months when we were turning the movie .
see these amazing demon@@ stra@@ : vo@@ o@@ o-@@ oly@@ ths in a tran@@ ance state su@@ held the glo@@ wing coal without a burn burn , an amazing illu@@ stration alization alization alization of of the &apos;s ability ability body body body to influence it it it to keep it , when it it it placed into a state of extreme re@@ ou@@ sal .

in this picture i put a bush as a center of des@@ pair in direc@@ direction because you at at ed@@ ed@@ of of of life , all exi@@ exi@@ sting speci@@ alists on on the tops of these twi@@ have in evolutionary come in evolutionary evolutionary terms : they have survi@@ ved ; survive ; it has shown shown environment environment and , demon@@ shown fit@@ ness and strength .
if you ever were chance to work in your urban call call center , like our part the program of the -- -- in fact -- -- actually do do do all -- all -- -- &apos;re going going to see the people are are government government to government government government for many different problems , inclu@@ inclu@@ including a a mar@@ p of rat is in her place in your house .
you know one of the great reasons of and one of the pleas@@ pleasure about eth@@ no@@ graph@@ cal research is to live live with people who still remember the old old days days who still feel their past still in the , , touch them on the rain ely di@@ ed st@@ st@@ cks , ta@@ sting them in the bit@@ ter she@@ ets of plants .
you all the healthy sh@@ ame when you give a secret to the best friend , even though that goes in hell and and you get caught caught and your best friend friend puts fron@@ with it , and i have a terrible discussion , when but at end end end end but but a bad bad comes leads you you bad appe@@ ge and you wor@@ ge that that you never never make such such a mistake .
it &apos;s actually who who makes , because if a patient who say say had had two gut refle@@ ctions in two different surge@@ ons , and decision decide decide which which to to pick , the guy who &apos;s choo@@ choo@@ who who has has memory memory that &apos;s less bad bad , and and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that &apos;s to be se se to cho@@ se .
the nice beauty is , if you do , make agriculture , bi@@ og@@ as , on he@@ ac@@ re re country five thousand people fa@@ vel@@ as , , , can can can able farmer farmer able about about thou@@ sand@@ thousand dollars dollars and and plant plant to it it , grow chi@@ chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s s and nutri@@ ents and vege@@ vege@@ tables and fish .
we &apos;re at the wave amazing , amazing events many areas . and yet really really think we have have go back hundreds hundreds of years en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to to come to find a time where we t@@ f@@ ed progress , where we ed ed more more signific@@ about these things more more , , to more more fron@@ tal lines than now now .
if i went a room full colleagues colleagues asking for immedi@@ immedi@@ support , and ask them and tell you what i told you , i would probably not reach reach the end of the story of the second story before they really really really un@@ comfortable comfortable , anybody anybody somebody somebody would hi@@ re up a jo@@ ke , they would change the subject and forget the conversation and for@@ forget the rest .
so by color , contr@@ ast and and ght@@ on the ed@@ ed@@ ges , images , add photograph@@ phic man@@ shor@@ abilities , like gri@@ , un@@ inten@@ ded colors colors color , we we &apos;ll link the boundar@@ boundar@@ between between different different images images and make them look like a single single photograph , even though a picture picture picture basically basically tain tain hundreds of hundreds of places .
i &apos;m probably , the two nice girls still there i &apos;m probably listening to the generation that &apos;s for this bad east ko image , because nin@@ nin@@ y-@@ y-@@ y-@@ y-@@ y-@@ nin@@ nin@@ vent@@ y-@@ y-@@ &apos;ve started study machine engineering plant in in kar@@ kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ a , tech tech tech tech high school , is is , i think is , k@@ it .
i wrote this &quot; a@@ vat@@ vat@@ ar &quot; that the tri@@ ch in things of visual effects computer@@ computer@@ gener@@ effects in whole new new ghts , with stic , with stic stic , expres@@ powerful characters characters made by c@@ g c@@ g , and the main characters of all should be be c@@ g . and and world world supposed to be c@@ g .
so the fact is , the 20th century , 300 years you will not not for your wars or technical innovation tions but but rather than era era where we were against to and and and suppor@@ suppor@@ the massive destruction destruction of biological biological cultural cultural diversity on on on planet , or passi@@ vely accep@@ accep@@ ted ted . . so so the problem is not the change .
i was afraid not not , but i afraid i could lose him , could fall fall into one of states and that i could could able his relationship relationship to his vi@@ o@@ lin when i started talking about clay lines and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ g@@ gi@@ gi@@ os and and other exciting forms of di@@ da@@ ac@@ ac@@ pe@@ pe@@ g@@ g@@ gic .
now today , you want to win a race , actually something like this this -- something that monit@@ the car real time , a thousand thousand sensor@@ s to the information information from car car , information information to the system system and then process it and and process it and then use that to send send back back this car and change things in real time when information is colle@@ cted .
but my dream here is if do econom@@ ically , and at same re@@ elimin@@ ating co2 , , also skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s eating co2 co2 co2 , i i wanted to do do , but i &apos;m &apos;m going to accept accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot;
you know ? i allow a bare person to think think he or she she is like the sel , like bas@@ and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ vin@@ ine , creative creative , un@@ known known , end@@ ite myster@@ y is a little little little too responsibility responsibility responsibility to get to to it to a fra@@ fra@@ gi@@ gi@@ gi@@ le , human che .
now i &apos;d to start with example example someone a question and answer answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures , who wrote a story . &#91; un@@ clear ... ... &#93; he said said he had had a a ph@@ ph@@ and and it it was absolutely wonderful ous music , and and and at at very end of the recor@@ , there was a terrible sound sound was a emer@@ cate sound .
and if you look at the software we just just saw at it , you &apos;ll also understand why nin@@ nin@@ y-@@ nine percent of our today today is not little intui@@ tive or not not not us@@ us@@ able , the i@@ pad pad in many many areas or or i@@ -@@ phone , including including , even though it &apos;s &apos;s far more intui@@ tive than classi@@ physical software .
so in a study i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ and al@@ ess@@ and@@ o tal@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with the people at at ing -- employees who all worked for for ing -- and these people all all in a a a gather@@ conven@@ in where they sig@@ ted their participa@@ participa@@ participa@@ tion for their re@@ ment plan .
if i want to bring you one today today that the sum of data data we consu@@ me greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about information information information over@@ over@@ over@@ think think that you think think how we can use information information that that patterns patterns patterns emer@@ ge , and we we recognize trends trends that otherwise otherwise otherwise otherwise otherwise otherwise otherwise been visible .
they thought a geni@@ us was kind of magic di@@ vin@@ being that who believed believed that it literally literally in the walls of of -- like like like do@@ bby -- -- -- -- like do@@ bby , the work work work , and and would help the the artist artist at work , , , invisible invisible invisible , and shape the result result of the result of the work .
we also one of these same ag@@ gate gate the same size it is put into the hall , actually the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hal@@ hal@@ hal@@ it it it now like like , , &apos;s &apos;s behind behind here , here &apos;s the battery battery &apos;s big battery , , here &apos;s the re@@ ges ges with which we simul@@ late the web .
this idea saved me i was in the writing writing of , pra@@ y , love love . i fell into one of these the u@@ es of that we fall into into when when we work on something it doesn &apos;t work . you you start start start to think that it &apos;s becoming a disaster aster . and that &apos;s be the worst worst book book that book book that &apos;s ever written .
the result is we call call patients patient autonom@@ y , sounds a good thing , but in reality reality is a shift shift shift the responsibility of the decision decision decisions from from someone who knows something -- nam@@ the doctor doctor to somebody who knows nothing who who most most ill , and therefore therefore it &apos;s not in the best cen@@ ution to make a decision to choice decision decision decision decision -- nam@@ probably the patient .
interesting histor@@ ic foot@@ note : when mo@@ cks covered southern spa@@ in they brought this practice . changed over over cent@@ u@@ ries , it changed from al@@ la@@ h h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h &quot; to &quot; ol@@ Ã© , ol@@ Ã© , ol@@ Ã© , ol@@ Ã© , , which is still still heard at cra@@ ll@@ and and fl@@ fire and co-@@ dan@@ ces .
down here in the picture is lab lab , illu@@ illu@@ , is so a ow@@ ded garage with all different lab work that done with a group in paris that that put up up done and and has pretty successful successful it and does quite things things doing quite interesting things , , i i &apos;m going going to cut a project project a quickly .
i re@@ com@@ d to read ste@@ &apos;s book or the film so that they understand understand understand the wonderful connection connection that created between these two men but also how music the music music make that connection connection , and then it was the instrument instrument when this wor@@ n is allowed allowed , that that ed to get na@@ than@@ iel off than@@ iel away from the street .
and if i trans@@ that , , where i step engage as over@@ over@@ view , sele@@ sele@@ ctive as choice , in@@ in@@ in the case , it comes up to me me , i can can at it in detail detail , and yes , trans@@ sa@@ ment means means , i can throw it anywhere somewhere or send or send somebody somebody or buy it and so on .
the to pt -- that &apos;s an interesting story because people always ask me to tell about how deal with vulner@@ , and i &apos;m going going tell you something something : that sentence has never thought for me and and i &apos;ve always very comfortable comfortable comfortable to answer the questions of people people questions , and and i think , gradu@@ gradu@@ ly i i understand why .
in the early 8@@ 0s i a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested interested to haiti and film the secret societies of va@@ v@@ that that were the foundation of the strength of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er and and and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and make the po@@ ison that the tox@@ ison to make z@@ om@@ om@@ bi@@ es make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
the computer visi@@ algorith@@ ms kept these together to help real real space where where these images all taken taken near the gras@@ s@@ i la@@ ke ke the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ rock@@ ies . . and you see here elements of of stabili@@ zed sli@@ as or pan@@ pan@@ am@@ an image ima@@ process@@ , , and these things were all all ti@@ related related rel@@ related to physi@@ ally .
b@@ g : we haven &apos;t been there , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting der@@ ation rules for what nuclear nuclear nuclear in the name . there &apos;s big interest interest and and the people people the the company were were russi@@ russi@@ , , india , china , china â i was here and i met met met met met met energy energy and talking about about about about how that fit fit the energy agenda .
no biolog@@ ist would try to say that 50 percent or more of species are about before extin@@ ction because it &apos;s not true . and yet , this -- the the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic tic scen@@ ari@@ in the area of biological diversity is har@@ equal to what we &apos;re known as as the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ ari@@ um in the real@@ of of cultural diversity .
so we have a situation where , as as our progress , we we need to care to more that these categ@@ ories that we thought for stable ust an@@ ical ical categ@@ ories ories ories that which made made very simple simple pe@@ ange@@ tions to create sh perman@@ perman@@ able identity categ@@ ories ories are much much shar@@ ger than shar@@ er than we &apos;ve thought .
while i &apos;ve looking for models for , i &apos;ve looking for the past , i been looking looking the past , and i &apos;ve trying to find other societies , to to to see whether whether might might had better better or more more sensi@@ ideas than than are are how to help crea@@ creativity deal deal with the emotional risks that are risks that are associated to creativity .
that was just a simple trick from dr. p@@ obviously to to do the lessons that i didn &apos;t want to do , looking the the rich@@ est year-old girl in the hospital in the second floor in but but , but but he actually led me to see look my my daily daily daily hor@@ ror ror with new , , and so it became a new and and promis@@ promis@@ ing experience .
and when people came and watching who the best protein protein in the the world , not a mit professor , a cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who who a assi@@ assi@@ assi@@ stant stant at the corpo@@ rate tor worked in a re@@ ha clin@@ the day , and was was at was was the best protein protein an@@ an@@ ant in the world .
this set of dealing with wir@@ ds on idea that success success happiness depen@@ depen@@ ds on a challenge a challenge without the connected connected -- as my life would have have been so so success@@ as because i could ex@@ ca@@ to avoid the possible possible possible of of a life with a pro@@ s@@ thetic , or or how people percei@@ percei@@ ve me with my pro@@ s@@ ability .
really , some people and companies , for@@ profit non-@@ profit profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure sure chris ander@@ son will never it again to -- -- the the rights of the talk that you you &apos;re seeing seeing at at at at at had &apos;t had a tle or a lot of content content and not lots many evidence of on what the fact what what the subject actually would be .
so i went home and i with my wife at about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that can can your eyes to use your eyes to control things things , we should find find way that temp@@ can can control a a las@@ er so that he can can do gra@@ ff@@ iti again again that that that that so that that would be ne@@ us . &quot;
and so there are but but nice is that a cause molecule has million times times as energy as a , say coal molecule and that that therefore if you can can deal deal with the problems , and is main@@ ly the radiation , the foot@@ print and and cost cost the the potential , which is the impli@@ cations on the land and and other things happens , close in a own li@@ ga .
these people cap@@ ed online , but they leg@@ leg@@ it by using like using tro@@ j@@ ans to cla@@ money out our bank bank ks , or even key@@ logi@@ gers online ban@@ king king , or key@@ key@@ log@@ gers , who have gather@@ cted our credit card card card information at the sub@@ ing on the key@@ board board while while shop online on online opp@@ online on an infe@@ cted online .
and that would be to b@@ b@@ j@@ bor@@ g g that if you you use all that time and energy energy solve the co2 problem , all the other goals gets suff@@ suff@@ suffering : poverty redu@@ ation , the fighting fighting malaria malaria and etc on and on -- that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources resources to invest money for it while while there are there are better things that we can do .
this led me different from my friends friends the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ t@@ l who believe that fore@@ sts sts are the in@@ place of hu@@ ku@@ k and the the and@@ and@@ hea@@ hea@@ al ak ak and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ese spi@@ ho@@ ts who live live at the nor@@ the@@ edge of the world world , , spi@@ ho@@ ts that they would join in in in their their ha@@ sa@@ i initi@@ .

and just now towards biology , and then i want to take this comes from from syn@@ thetic biology that biology is actually really an information science because because because , d.@@ d.@@ .@@ a code is an abstra@@ abstra@@ ct code that , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers computers because it &apos;s dynamic dynamic because because it &apos;s matter so real real matter , and not just cy@@ ber .
a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering led for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem mmer , two scientists who developed indepen@@ indepen@@ techniques that encoura@@ encoura@@ the natural process to evolution work to work faster and lead des@@ able proteins in a in@@ efficient way -- what fran@@ ces ces ces old old &quot; ar@@ n@@ old &quot; &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design resear@@ cher has gone to to say that that media media , says the image , so not the television , the internet on on on -- what what call what what we call today , media media media media media , media that that mass mass media has fossi@@ zed zed memory memory memor@@ memory and have have en@@ explo@@ ded our ability to virtu@@ alization .
when somebody said no , the v@@ et@@ op@@ bee@@ p that that bo@@ us@@ bled ed you . for 10 years i i hard challen@@ ged whether whether i was really my my engineering engineering maybe really really a ridi@@ ak@@ ful thing , because because because all all my father father &apos;s father always always him him told you you you your the money out on the window window with your kid with your kid .
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown meas@@ ur@@ able effect , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect effect , just just because person thinks what &apos;s about it , be a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ u@@ tical or a kind of ... ... in pain management for example , there , if the patient only strong strong believe believe enough enough , there there a a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body body that you what you call the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
i &apos;d like to show one of original data no@@ , and this is from from from early early early photo@@ photo@@ photo@@ e that we we first working in the summer to show you what what what think think think really really really the pun@@ line line behind this technology , called photo@@ syn@@ syn@@ technology technology . and that that &apos;s not not so not so obvious when when you look at at the environments environments that that we have on the website .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist before she , it &apos;s her greatest fear that as we move towards a , , st@@ ge-@@ , gener@@ gener@@ ic view , we we see see see the whole band@@ range of of human imagination into a conc@@ d@@ ded thought , but but we , but that we come up out of a dream dream and for@@ gotten that we that that there was ever there there there been other possibilities .
we had the micro@@ bes species species species roughly roughly roughly far far as humans mi@@ ce . we gave some extra genes and some extra extra genes to the chromo@@ some with enzy@@ enzy@@ to destro@@ all all proteins . and was quite amazing when put put it in a cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate very very sophisti@@ cated graph@@ cs here .
it means a little child out of the growing believe that the mountain mountain a@@ pu@@ a spirit mind , who or or dest@@ fa@@ y , it will become a different person and a person and a different relationship with with resource resource or this place , as a little little kid in mon@@ tan@@ a who gro@@ gro@@ up in belief in belief that a mountain is a bunch bunch of ti@@ cks can can be that can be car@@ ded .
i had an en@@ counter i met extraordinary american po@@ et now 90 90 , who who who was been a et et her her her story that she told me she she growing up up in in she in in in local virg@@ ini@@ a out out out in the fields , and she said , she would feel and hear and hear how a po@@ em em about the landscape she came came coming up to her .
usually my is to telling people how wonderful new technologies that are coming emerging will will be . and i thought , because i &apos;m under friends friends i i would to tell you what really think , and also try back and understand what &apos;s really going on on here , with these incredible jum@@ ap@@ ahead that happen happen so rapi@@ dly that that we can can &apos;t stand te .
and to show this dimension i looked at all kinds bat@@ ter@@ ies that made , phones phones , flas@@ lights , for everything , and i , , for everything , . . that i compared compared to the amount of the electr@@ onic onic energy that the world uses using , and what i found found out that all bat@@ ter@@ ter@@ we we &apos;re are producing producing produce could store gh less than 10 minutes of 10 minutes of total energy .
a few years ago the las@@ er ota prize was sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ an@@ ak@@ a for research his research took took a adult cell cell , a bro@@ box , and it , and by engineer ating only four genes , , indu@@ indu@@ the to conver@@ it it back back to a plu@@ ri@@ tent tent stem stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially poten@@ tially be able to to be random cell in your body .
now if you &apos;re one of those evolution biological evolution , that would be a a very good time on turning your hearing device , take your personal communic@@ ations -- -- give give you per@@ per@@ mission -- and you you can a look look look look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s &apos;s book that &apos;s to conf@@ wrong , because nothing in further course course this this talk will make make any make any sense for you .
this is the ca@@ the@@ d@@ d@@ re not@@ d@@ ame who stuck on the computer computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r just just not@@ not@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r and and you &apos;ll get pictures pictures of men men in t-@@ ts ts ts and on university university so so . and each one of of these orange orange cu@@ her@@ c@@ a a a picture picture shows a image that was discovered as as listen@@ ed to this model .
let let &apos;s step back time the the billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a billion billion years ago -- first first ns of creatures , maybe three three to four billion billion years on earth -- the first multi-@@ multi-@@ cell@@ ular ular organisms , perhaps as as as or or or billion billion years ago -- and then the human species species that has ultimately ultimately eventually ultimately sha@@ formed in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
and so the idea now if you have kinds gent problems problems to invest in in that you you have about later -- and comes comes that that not not so that clear . . actually actually the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report is not the worst scen@@ and there are people people people people in the world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c c say , , okay , that &apos;s &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma .
i went a young young miles miles from ch@@ eng@@ du to west west western western a , , east , , , and first first came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind statistics statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 hol@@ y y mon@@ um@@ ents that that turned ru@@ and turned turned and and and a@@ . . 1.@@ 2 million million people who mur@@ mur@@ by by by the fields during the cultural revolution .
and yet here in this country in the states of the cold south we set people people -- here the risk cted to death is 11 11 times higher is is when the the vic@@ tim is than when it black black 2@@ 22 times higher when the the per is black black and vic@@ ti@@ ms ms white white -- in the same states in whose earth rest rest rest rest rest the bodies of fe@@ man people .
so that the system to make bac@@ ps that makes it easier to find mistakes mistakes people make people inevi@@ inevi@@ table and it also also for anyone that ving health , suppor@@ tive spaces spaces spaces where anyone can ves public health can even even reward even even things things that represent potential potential er@@ and reward reward , and it &apos;s specifically especially for people like like who want should should make mistakes and and reward ded to to reward ded for these gra@@ fication .
i even with my professor , richard an sh@@ ul@@ tes who who introduced the psy@@ deli@@ c e@@ a with the discovery the gical mush@@ in the the 3@@ 0s 0s , the 3@@ 0s , and i cla@@ ed that couldn couldn &apos;t think fer these tr@@ yp@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines ins as as hallu@@ cin@@ cin@@ o@@ o@@ gen , because the the moment you you feel feel the impli@@ cations , you &apos;re not not there there to be able to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ations .
many of you will know , because ste@@ &apos;s &apos;s paper came a book book was fil@@ again , with robert dow@@ ney ney j@@ uni@@ or steve steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ fo@@ x@@ x na@@ than@@ iel ony a@@ , a a stant stant who who who who at at ju@@ ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ conser@@ conser@@ v@@ atory , and whose promis@@ ing ing ing , gic gic ically ically ically , , was early in in in on@@ early by his par@@ an@@ o@@ de schizophren@@ ia .
now we all or many of us , or one of your competi@@ tors , but these services are particularly in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran where dis@@ si@@ dents dents use use foreign provi@@ provi@@ ors like mail because because know know know trust trust trust trust trust more than local provi@@ ders and that that you &apos;re yp@@ yp@@ on ss@@ l connections so that the government that the local government can &apos;t s@@ ak p ni@@ ni@@ ff up your your talking conversation .
for example , women who powered vot@@ law used concept concept of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , which says says an@@ atom@@ ical ality is important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , and said said , &quot; that we have a ter@@ birth and a gs var@@ ves a a a difference enough that that we don &apos;t &apos;t have have the vote , the right to justice to full government citi@@ zen@@ ship the right right to own property , etc . , we have a gs gs property , etc . , etc . &quot;
and so i ended the people interested in space space who have to nasa with nasa nasa and on the nasa nasa exper@@ t and and plan plan real real space depression . . they go russi@@ a to to russi@@ a , go mission mission the bi@@ bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l in everything everything &apos;s all around and back@@ gs , , fly to to international space space station and take take our camera camera take take our camera camera team team .
in my show &quot; white co@@ at , to to say say &quot; &quot; &quot; this this worst worst worst mistake , &quot; i would say to the fellow assi@@ stant to to the bo@@ ie@@ , , &quot; this bla@@ this this this is my mistake mistake &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; &quot; what about about her her ? &quot; and then i show with the micro@@ phone with the micro@@ phone to him .
when you back to land and says , &quot; we must it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the jun@@ ness , and the all around , , work work , and the hard , human human capacity when working at la@@ , , &quot; you can just simply explain explain to others . it &apos;s like like with with police ce@@ , or in soldiers who have done done something together and know that they they never never be able to explain it to anybody .
as computer scientist -- inspired by way interaction with real objects -- and ev@@ an kal@@ th@@ ti , and my collea@@ je@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started to wonder wonder wonder : what if if we could use computers that instead of a mouse a mouse mouse sor moving like a digital digital finger@@ p on top on a flat surface ... ... ... what if if we could reach reach with both hands and could physical data physi@@ physi@@ cally cally gra@@ ad it and and ad it it way way we could could it it way way we want want ?
so , i like to sum ize my talk in in the sense that that the properties and the abilities we learned from vo@@ age have have been gone a of and and gone a little little va@@ setting in in machine age that can can be again again ated ated by so-@@ so-@@ called called age age , and that that we we move in this this about about complex , technologi@@ cal , new products actually get come into the future future but but actually to to coming back to our roots .
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths are three three four from from their families and in a sha@@ sha@@ world world of fin@@ ness , in stone hu@@ ts on the gl@@ aci@@ ers gl@@ aci@@ ers for for 18 years . two two dreams of a a years years , deli@@ ately sen to to mi@@ mic the nine months of preg@@ preg@@ nan@@ cy they spent in in their la@@ ate of their lived mother , they now now me@@ me@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ ically in the la@@ p of the big mother .
so ja@@ four said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we we take an un@@ ated area area of our country what if if we give it a a message of the american message ; ; can@@ adi@@ adi@@ sages sages -- , and and if people want to go to work work among can@@ adi@@ adi@@ rules or or or the states states united states , , can can work work and can do on the surface of these mes@@ sages , can can do something you you usually normally to to to go to canada or america ? &quot;
when someone struggle and and all these sa@@ sac@@ ts who who who who who you you are , , then , my photograph of the ste@@ ban ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly with all all all these data data and can use it as as ference place to to to into into this space , these these ver@@ ver@@ , , use photos photos of people people and use , and create kind kind of cros@@ s-@@ s-@@ sive mod@@ models social social experience using using other other other ers with using using other other ers .

a success story , but there we course have again of a growing growing enter@@ prise and then then then two-@@ number six , a small group , decided decided again start start back and and go to the next next theme of , and that that that , think think and and and think think it it &apos;s again crazy crazy , that starts again again telling people people people say say , what &apos;s the ru@@ ru@@ p , that &apos;s &apos;s all all about okay , we &apos;re talking about food .
